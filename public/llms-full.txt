# Miami Herald Covers the Neil Rogers Audio Recovery Project

_by Michael Allen Smith - April 2018_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Miami Herald Story (2018)

Yesterday, I was interviewed by Jose Lambiet for a story about this website and the YouTube channel we created as a tribute to Neil Rogers.

![Miami Herald story on Neil Rogers project](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fmiami_herald_neil.DLa6tdEb.jpg&#38;fm=jpg&#38;w=698&#38;h=854)

Talk host Neil Rogers is dead, but his radio archive lives on

It is a good article and I hope it attracts new fans and maybe new audio will be recovered.

> Side note: If you know someone that works inside Yahoo!, read the Support section on our Docs page.

There were a few minor errors, which are probably to blame on my cell phone, which cut out several times during the interview.

- John Baker had his own personal collection of NEIL from the late 1980s. The audio we recovered before then and during the WIOD era (as well as the 1998 shows), were sent to him to restore, remaster, and convert to digital.
- I don't recall saying John was in Boca, but he might have lived there in the 1980s. John lived in Gainesville.
- I also don't know if Nick Abbot ever played Neil bits on his show. I do know Neil was an influence, which you can see on his [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Abbot) page or his [X](https://x.com/NIAbbot/status/985125553308127233) feed.
- Typo: “I moved to D.C. and I couldn't a radio signal in my office.” It should have read “I moved to D.C. and I couldn't **get** a radio signal in my office.”
- Neil was born in Rochester, NY not Canada.
- The archives aren't mine. They belong to all the fans.

Here are some additional notes on the timeline of the project:

- June 12, 2009 — The last Neil Rogers Show
- December 24, 2010 — Neil Rogers dies
- 2011 — [Eric Harold](https://neilrogers.org/docs/eric-harold/) (Neil's web guy dies)
- 2011 — I start sharing audio via a Google Sites page
- 2012 — The Neil Rogers YouTube channel is launched
- 2012 — John Baker partners with me and we begin to build out the archive.
- 2012 — NeilRogers.org starts
- 2017 — [John Baker](https://neilrogers.org/docs/john-baker/) dies.

The archive has almost 1,900 shows. Over 2,000 if you count other shows besides NEIL. This is 5,000 hours of commercial-free audio.

[My Tribute to Radio's Neil Rogers](https://criticalmas.org/2014/01/tribute-radios-neil-rogers/) — Blog post on the early history of the project

John Baker was the NEIL expert. Much more than me. I was the technical guy. When Eric Harold died, I stepped in to help out, because I have a background in programming, databases, and creating websites in general.

# Tribute to Jorge Rodriguez

Neil's radio producer and guest host.

_by Michael Allen Smith - July 6, 2020_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Tribute to Jorge Rodriguez

On Friday July 3rd, Jorge Rodriguez died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 55. Jorge was the long time producer and guest host for the Neil Rogers Show. After the Neil Rogers Show ended, Jorge continued with the Jorge Rodriguez Show, which he broadcasted online from his own SoFloRadio channel.

![Jorge Rodriguez and Neil Rogers](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fjorge-and-neil-hof.BL83Arbe.jpg&#38;fm=jpg&#38;w=800&#38;h=450)

Jorge Rodriguez and Neil Rogers

I never met Jorge, but exchanged a few emails with him over the years whenever we recovered old episodes of the Neil Rogers Show where he was a guest host. Prior to Neil being inducted into the [Radio Hall of Fame](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-hall-of-fame/), Jorge reached out to me to create a video to be used in the ceremony.

My partner on the audio restoration project John Baker had more contact with Jorge. They worked together to bring all the Neil Rogers tribute shows that Jorge recorded over to the [Neil Rogers Tributes playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8h2eiL0gjh82mLXapFfo-Zp2zT0SF439) on our YouTube channel.

![The Jorge Rodriguez Show](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fjorge-show-logo.CjodG4ts.png&#38;fm=png&#38;w=360&#38;h=120)

When Neil was on break, Jorge rebranded the show's website. 😂

With the passing of Jorge Rodriguez, the list of people that really knew the history of the Neil Rogers Show continues to shrink.

Shortly after Neil died in 2010, his web guy [Eric Harold](https://neilrogers.org/docs/eric-harold/) died at the age of 48. It was Eric's death that was the spark that ignited the race to recover as much audio as we could from the Neil Rogers Show. [John Baker](https://neilrogers.org/docs/john-baker/) was a tremendous help in making that happen. Almost 2,000 shows and [1,000 photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilrogersradio/) were added to the archive. John passed in 2017. Then Suds Coleman died in 2019. Now Jorge is gone.

Jorge will be missed. In addition to the several tribute shows he donated to the [Neil Rogers Show YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeilRogersRadio), we have recovered 239 shows where Jorge was the guest host for Neil. Those shows can be found by following the links on the [Neil Rogers Audio page](https://neilrogers.org/audio/).

# Tribute to John Baker

Neil historian and audio archivist.

_by Michael Allen Smith - October 26, 2017_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Tribute to John Baker

Yesterday morning I received word that my friend John Baker had died. I do not know the cause of death, but I was aware he had been battling a sickness for a week that left him very tired.

For the past five years, John was my partner on the Neil Rogers Audio Restoration project. We communicated via Facebook Messenger on a near-daily basis and occasionally we would chat on the phone. We both shared a common goal, which was to recover as much audio from the Neil Rogers Show as we could and make those recordings accessible to his fans.

Here is a snippet from an article about the project titled [Rogers still the talk of S. Florida Radio](https://neilrogers.org/rogers-still-the-talk-of-s-florida-radio-january-5-2014/) that appeared in both the Miami Herald and Sun-Sentinel in January 2014.

![neil rogers news story](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fjohn-baker-news.CXuY67iE.png&#38;fm=png&#38;w=800&#38;h=412)

Neil Rogers news story

John was able to convert any analog format into digital from cassettes to videotapes to reel-to-reel recorders. Almost every recovered show prior to January 1999 went through his hands. He was not only able to transfer audio to digital he had an amazing ability to be able to date a show by just listening to a few minutes.

There were a few times when John would receive a box of tapes in the mail without dates or incorrect dates and weeks later every clip of audio would be dated in the right sequence and handed off to me to add to our digital archives.

If there was a sound drop that we didn't know who to credit, John would start sending out messages. He might spend a few hours trying to identify a 2-second clip. That is dedication.

In 2013, John produced and hosted [a show of Neil Rogers tributes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUF91XeQyMQ).

Out of his own pocket, John paid for whatever equipment he needed to complete a task. He paid for postage and even took road trips to meet up with other fans of Neil with audio to share.

He was a tremendous asset and without him, we would not have nearly as much audio as we were able to find. In addition to audio, John recovered numerous news stories related to Neil Rogers and South Florida radio and added them to this website. And over [1,000 photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilrogersradio/) too.

With John's passing, Neil fans have lost a true historian. The upside is John was able to share much of his knowledge before he went. As of today, we have recovered over 5,000 hours of audio from Neil Rogers and other South Florida radio. Without John, a lot of that audio would have been lost forever.

He will be greatly missed. RIP John.

# Tribute to Eric Harold

The original Neil webmaster.

_by Michael Allen Smith - February 22, 2016_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Tribute to Eric Harold

Eric Harold was Neil's web guy. He coded, hosted and maintained the NeilRogers.com website. Throughout the WQAM years and even before — Eric made sure that the fans of the Neil Rogers Show could listen to the show live or download shows via the archives.

Unfortunately, Eric Harold passed away at the age of 48 in [March of 2011](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2011-03-31-os-daily-deathlist-040111-20110331-story.html). This was just months after Neil Rogers, who passed away on December 24, 2010. Eric was a one-man operation, so when no one was left to continue hosting and maintaining the NeilRogers.com website, it went offline in late 2011.

During the very early days of the Neil Rogers audio restoration project, I started an email to Eric introducing myself and how I could volunteer the shows I recovered from 1999 to a much larger project. Halfway through the email is when I discovered I was too late and that he had passed away.

![Eric Harold](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Feric-harold.jUoF16vZ.jpg&#38;fm=jpg&#38;w=430&#38;h=600)

Eric Harold

If you are interested in seeing the old website, the site archive.org took numerous snapshots going back to late 1998.

[web.archive.org/web/*/neilrogers.com](https://web.archive.org/web/*/neilrogers.com)

![NeilRogers.com banner](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fneilrogers-website-logo.kP-SSlXk.png&#38;fm=png&#38;w=512&#38;h=137)

NeilRogers.com banner

Eric was also responsible for making sure the Daily Polls that became such an important part of the show were working.

![NeilRogers.com poll](https://neilrogers.org/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2Fneilrogers-2004-poll.BwnTTk7t.png&#38;fm=png&#38;w=463&#38;h=357)

Neil Rogers Daily Poll from June 2004

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, most radio shows did not have a website of the caliber created by Eric. These days we take for granted that we can listen live or download shows we missed from the archives. Back then it was rare. Being one of the first to both stream live and host archives extended the popularity of Neil Rogers nationally and internationally.

[Joe Castello](https://wforadio.com/) who worked with Neil Rogers at WQAM said this recently about Eric.

> One of the best human beings that has walked the Earth.

Eric resided in Orlando and away from the Miami market. I'd love to update this post if someone that was close to him comes forward with more information to share. It is also possible that many years of old Neil Rogers Shows reside on one of his servers or backup media.

I would like to thank Eric Harold for making the Neil Rogers Show accessible to me. I never lived in Miami or even heard the show live, but thanks to Eric became a fan via the audio archives on the NeilRogers.com website.

# My Neil Rogers Story

_by [Jaz McKay](https://x.com/DeplorableJaz) - April 5, 2025_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > My Neil Rogers Story

As the only weekend part-timer with any talent and ability at Cox Media Group’s, 610 - WIOD in the early to mid 1990’s I was the go to guy to fill in for most of the full time talk show hosts. I had filled in for Chuck Meyer, Rick & Suds and Randi Rhodes numerous times. When it was the holiday season, I worked every single day of the week for three to four weeks in a row. I was called the “Hardest working man in Miami talk radio.” But there was one person at WIOD who never had a fill in host, the legendary Neil Rogers. Neil was such a massive superstar of Miami radio that the only person, who could fill in for Neil, was actually Neil.

Substitute hosts had been used earlier, at other stations, but it was far from successful, Neil’s loyal listeners wouldn’t put up with it. The station would be flooded with calls, both to the front desk and on the air. The fill in guys were ripped to shreds by the callers, nobody ever got out alive.

Jaz McKay on WIOD

Neil’s listeners were hardcore; I always called them the devoted "Neilephites." They were a tribe of loyal followers who’d trek through the rough and rugged radio wilderness to follow their irreverent societal prophet anywhere he led them, the ones who would shout, “Neil, God!” at the top of their lungs over the phone. Neil’s fans were known for their fierce dedication to him because of his biting humor and unfiltered no holds barred, kick in the ass of the faux-grandiosity inherent in the upper crust of the cultural elites of South Florida. Neil had the highest ratings of any radio host in Miami; he consistently pulled double digits in all demographics. In fact it wasn’t unusual for Neil to carry an entire station.

Then there’s the calls Neil took, he didn’t even want to know the subject or reason for your call, just the caller’s name and the city they were calling from. He took calls on any subject what-so-ever, nothing was off limits. The calls came from a wide variety South Floridians, lunatics, morons and masochists who would risk Neil’s wrath to try and entertain him. That was really the role of the caller’s on the Neil Rogers show, to entertain the host. If you were good Neil would heap tons of praise and say, “Great call, I love it,” however if you failed he’d ridicule you for the next hour with profane innuendos and obscene sound effects from his vast array of drop-ins. In fact if your call was exceptionally entertaining his long time producer, Jorge Rodriguez might pull a snippet out and add it to the collection of Neil’s sound effects and voice drops. Neil’s show was unique in that it wasn’t just stream of consciousness; it was a wide roaring river of biting wit, unfiltered opinions, and relentless humor that swept listeners along for the ride and if Neil wasn’t there in person, it better be Neil on tape or there would be a revolt.

If for any reason he couldn’t be there, whether he was off on a cruise, in Vegas gambling or just out with a cold, his midday shift between 10 and 2 was covered by Jorge who would always host the “Best of the Neil Rogers Show.” And the “Best of...” shows always consisted of him introducing various clips of Neil from past programs, and believe it or not the audience ate it up. They got to hear the best callers, Neil’s most epic rants, and their favorite comedy bits; his shows usually weren’t dated because Neil rarely talked about “issues of the day,” political or otherwise. His show was almost exclusively social commentary. Also, Jorge was a real producer, not just a button pusher, he meticulously went over hours of tapes of the Neil Rogers Show to select bits and pieces that weren’t dated or in any way dull, Jorge actually produced, what the name implied, “A Best of Show,” not just a random program from a month ago played in its entirety.

As I said, Neil’s show was not the usual topic or issue driven talk radio show. Neil’s nickname was “Nasty Neil,” for obvious reasons and his show could be about … anything, anything on his mind at the moment, maybe he’d talk about his experience at dinner the night before, sports, or the latest gossip about some celebrity or politician. He loved cutting people down to size too. He especially hated pertinacious people in positions of power or prestige. His favorite targets were the media types in Miami, TV news anchors or reporters and newspaper columnists were all targets but what he relished the most was offering his, somewhat, shall we say ‘biting commentary’ regarding his fellow radio broadcasters. Other hosts from the three other talk radio stations, both local and syndicated, were his favorite targets, also on some occasions a disc jockey on a top 40 or rock station would get under his skin, if so look out. Or maybe he’d pay some media dude a compliment, it was rare but it happened. Neil was an equal opportunity offender, but he really appreciated talent and most importantly, honesty. Rather than rip you apart, if he liked you or what you did he’d let his listeners know.

Neil Rogers had been a midday powerhouse at WINZ-AM 940 since 1976, stepping into the slot vacated by Larry King, who’d bolted for a national gig. By 1978, Neil owned the 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift, turning it into Miami’s top-rated talk show with his razor-sharp wit. Fast forward to 1987, the folks at Gannett Publishing, who owned WINZ, decided to shake things up. They transplanted Neil to the morning drive show at WZTA 94.9, better known as Zeta 4, a rock station struggling to find its footing. Starting in 1987, Neil took over the 6 to 10 a.m. slot; his ratings magic didn’t miss a beat, hauling Zeta 4 to #1 in the morning, a feat that left the station’s rock roots in the dust because his show was 100% talk, no music. Neil propped up the whole station on his shoulders for as long as he could, but once the clock hit 10 a.m., the ratings took a nosedive, plummeting to dismal depths. Midday through early evenings showed up with a 0.5 to a 1 share, I mean it was embarrassing, it sucked bad.

After Neil Rogers left Zeta 4 in the fall of 1988, he finally moved to WIOD, where he was back in the midday time slot from 10 am to 2 pm, a shift he was more suited for. WIOD was a news-talk powerhouse and it gave Neil a broader platform to flex his talk radio muscle including years of double digit ratings, something unheard of in a city the size of Miami.

At WIOD the programming department built the entire radio station around Neil. While the morning show with Chuck Meyer was a standard Full Service talk format, very structured, news twice an hour, traffic and weather on the tens, one feature per hour with a quick interview. It was very fast passed and geared to a “give us 20 minutes and we’ll give you the world” type of programming. It was a no nonsense, news and information show, but at ten o’clock everything changed, you had Neil Rogers hanging up on people, followed by Rick & Suds, a very funny and likable team that consisted of Rick Riley and "Suds" Coleman, formerly the morning show at WAXY, they moved over to afternoons on WIOD the same time as Neil. There was a great sports talk show with former Miami Dolphin, Jim “Mad Dog” Mandich and then at night you had Randi Rhodes a fiery, progressive talk radio host who carved out a big name in South Florida before going national. After Randi, it was a replay of the Don & Mike show, piped in from WJFK in Washington DC.

At the time WIOD was one of the originators of what became the “Hot Talk” format. No longer was talk radio boring. Gone was the investment and financial talk; gone were the lame interviews with some city councilmen about a bond issue or a new crosswalk going in on Main Street, talk radio was changing, it was evolving, it had become exciting, edgy and in your face, this wasn’t your grandpa’s talk radio.

You have to remember, this is the era of Howard Stern, The Greaseman and Mancow Muller. “Shock Radio” was the big craze, but it was usually restricted to morning drive on a youth oriented rock station, it was never an entire station format, but in the late 1980’s it was and it ruled the Miami market from the studios of 610 - WIOD.

So, I was a perfect fit for WIOD and I was hired there for a Saturday and Sunday shift in the fall of 1993. The program director, Gary Bruce had brought me back to Miami from Lansing, Michigan where I was doing a morning show at the first Classic Rock station in America, 92.7 WMMQ. My morning show was huge and I was really successful at least until I got my ass fired for some, shall we say, internal conflicts with management over my behavior off the air.

That’s always been my downfall, despite the depths of rude & obnoxious radio I was capable of producing, (I’m talking some truly “Hard R Rated or Adult Stuff” like a stripper, filling in for my vacationing newsman, reading the “News in the Nude”, any number of sexually explicit songs or pre-recorded comedy bits, or Bong Hit Mondays, where callers were invited to call in to “Wake and Bake with Jaz McKay” by taking a bong hit live on the air with us.) I was never fired for anything I said or did on the air, it was always some stupid thing I did off the air, usually under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Those things might include accidentally faxing some pornographic pictures to the wrong person, getting in a bar fight and breaking some dudes jaw, getting nabbed by the cops or posting a joke on social media that goes horribly wrong (Ooops). It was always off-mic mischief, never the show itself. Call me a maestro of chaos off-air, a whirlwind of bad decisions, but a rock-solid pro when the red light glowed, except, of course, for those occasional dalliances with the aforementioned substances I frequently abused that might’ve left me a bit too loose on the dial.

As I said, doing weekends at WIOD was the perfect place for me in the early 90’s, I had been at the station about three months or so when I got that call from Neil’s producer, Jorge Rodriquez. As I remember it, it was a Tuesday morning and I’d been out very late the night before, getting hammered as I did most every night back in the bad old days. I started the night before with Monday Night Football at The Goalpost Grill in Pembroke Pines, and ended up at Crazy Jims, a nudie bar in Hallandale. Copious amounts of Miller High-Life, bourbon and a few rounds of Goldschläger were involved and I was still a little drunk when my phone rang.

“Hello…” I said, my voice cracking as I tried to pull the cobwebs out of my mouth.

“Jaz, its Jorge, can you fill in for Neil today, he’s sick?”

“Wait, what? Nobody fills in for Neil. Don’t you always run a Best of…?”

“Yeah well, you’re the first in a long time if you wanna do it, he asked me to call you.”

I looked at the clock radio next to my bed, it was 8:40 am, Neil went on at 10AM and as I said I was pretty damned hung-over, in reality I was actually still pretty drunk.

“Look, I know it’s short notice,” Jorge said, “and if you can’t do it I understand but, Neil asked me to call you and remember, nobody has ever filled in for Neil on WIOD and if you say no he may never ask you again and think of it this way, Neil’s show is the most listened to radio show in all of South Florida, not to mention the simulcast on WSUN in Tampa. You’ll have millions of listeners Jaz.”

“I’ll fucking be there Jorge.” I said.

No chance I’d let that golden ticket slip from my grasp, Jorge nailed it, this wasn’t just a shot at the biggest radio audience in the entire great, phallic shaped state of Florida, but to be asked by the Godfather of Miami Talk Radio himself to break years of precedence and actually fill that chair at WIOD from 10am till 2pm was a damn freaking privilege. And not only that, but consider the fact that I’d only been at the station for just three months. Yeah, Neil and I had known each other for a few years, going back to when I was doing mornings at the EZ Communications, Urban Condemnatory powerhouse, WHQT - Hot 105. Back then when my producer Jim and I would produce a recorded comedy bit too racy for our station, we’d give it to Neil. A few times we produced bits exclusively for his show and he always praised our efforts but as far as the listeners of WIOD were concerned I was still “the new guy on the weekend.” But what better way to break out of that mold than to throw the dice and crack the code of the Neil Rogers show by opening the microphone at 10:05 to say, “Neil’s out sick today so you’re stuck with me, Jaz McKay for the next four hours, aren’t you lucky?”

I opted to skip the shower entirely, just splashed some water on my face, brushed my teeth, and yanked my hair into a ponytail while the coffee maker gurgled in the kitchen. My place was up in Miami Gardens, and the station sat out in North Bay Village, perched on an island smack in the heart of Biscayne Bay. It was a solid 30 to 45 minute haul if traffic didn’t screw me over. Time wasn’t on my side, so I floored it out of there around 9:15.

Back in those days, I was piloting a boat of a car, a battle-scarred 1985 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. This beast, a true road titan, boasted traditional luxury stature with a 121.5-inch wheelbase and an overall length stretching beyond 18 feet. That beauty reigned as the undisputed king of Cadillac’s in the '80s, the last of the Detroit Land Yachts before General Motors leaned harder into downsizing. That monster could haul ass.

I didn’t set any speed records in that behemoth, but I made it just in time, barely by the skin of my teeth in fact, around 9:55. I drove through the gate the Isle of Dreams parking lot, that’s what it was called, you see when 610 WIOD first signed on the air in the late 1920’s, it was owned by the Isle of Dreams Broadcasting Company, earning its call letters that sang out "Wonderful Isle Of Dreams."

I’ve worked at plenty of radio stations, but I’ll tell you this, none were ever nestled in such a beautiful location as WIOD. Most are housed in slate and sterile office buildings or in strip malls, but WIOD had a front-row seat to a jaw-dropping view of Miami Beach in the distance. That scene was so striking photographers turned it into postcards for sale in the hotels and resorts off in the distance. Once, as a part of a part of a Hot 105 on air promotion, I snagged a ride on the Goodyear blimp in that same vicinity. That was an adventure that ranks among the wildest thrills of my life.

The bay buzzed with sailboats slicing through the waves and windsurfers skimming with fearless flair, while over on the beach, kites dotted the sky and folks savored South Florida’s sun-soaked charm in leisurely bliss. Words fall short of capturing it; that beauty was one of a kind.

I guided that Colossus Cadillac Cruiser through the parking lot, easing it into a tight spot near the back door. As I stepped out, headphones in hand, the station’s security guard, a real nice old gentleman named Marty caught sight of me and tossed a friendly wave my way.

“Hey Jaz, how’s it goin’?” he shouted with a big smile.

“Doing good Marty, I’m covering for Neil today, I guess he’s out sick.”

“Neil Rogers? Nobody steps in for Neil, they just play his greatest hits!”

“Not this time,” I shot back. “Not this time.”

I tapped in the door code and entered the building, the sales offices and management were on the first floor and the air studios were located upstairs, so I sprinted up the back stairwell and made my way through the door from the stairwell and down the hallway past the production studios, and our Contemporary Hit Radio station, WFLC &ndash; Hits 97 just as the midday jock, Anna Maria, was headed in the studio door.

“Hey Jaz McKay, what are you doing here on a Tuesday?” she asked.

“I got a call from Jorge, I replied, fast-walking down the corridor, “I’ve got to fill in for Neil, he’s sick,”.

“Filling in for Neil? Nobody fills in for Neil; they just run a best-of show!” Anna Maria shouted back.

“Not today,” I said. “Today it’s me.”

Coming to the entrance to the WIOD studios, I opened the heavy door that led into the soundlock area, a vestibule between the hallway and the on-air studio and the control room. Inside, I looked up to see the red light on over the studio door. Through the window, I spotted Chuck Meyer, the WIOD morning show host, his voice muffled as he wrapped up his show.

Just then Jorge stuck his head out of master control and said, “Jaz, thanks for doing this on such short notice. I just want you to know the Neil Rogers Show is only hosted by Neil Rogers; nobody has filled in for him in a very long time, not to put any pressure on you but, well, good luck.”

“Don’t worry brother, I got this.” I said back, not truly believing the words myself.

“Okay then, break a leg,” he said pulling back into the control room, the big door slowly closing behind him. I stood there, trying to catch my breath and that’s when it hit me: what was I going to talk about? Holy crap, I hadn’t even thought about it. I didn’t do issue-oriented talk radio back then, but I usually had a few solid ideas. Yet, at that moment, with about five or six minutes to go, I was completely blank. It was a whirlwind of relief and panic. Just then, the on-air light went off and I pushed open the door.

Chuck, an older more conservative, traditional radio show host, was taking off his headphones and winding up the cord, he looked up in surprise when he saw me shuffle in.

“Jaz, what are you doing here?” he said.

“I got a call from Jorge, Neil’s out today and I’m filling in for him.” I shot back as I moved around the studio grabbing my big rolling cart racks of sound effects and drop-in’s moving them behind the control board.

“Wait a minute,” Chuck said looking down at the floor and then up at me while pointing his finger, “Neil’s sick and you’re filling in? Neil doesn’t have fill-in hosts, nobody can fill in for Neil, and they always run a best of show. Are you sure someone’s not pulling your leg?”

“What do you thinks’ going to happen?” I asked, “Right at ten o’clock Neil’s gonna come bursting in the door saying ‘April Fools?’ Look, Neil’s out sick and I’m filling in today, okay? Get used to it. Everybody’s acting like we’ve opened the gates into Bizarro World just because Neil’s asked me to substitute for him. Relax, Chuck, we're not rewriting the laws of the universe here!"

“Okay, I just hope he’s not setting you up to take a fall.” Chuck said as he gathered up the remainder of his belongings and walked out shaking his head.

I slid into the chair behind the studio control board, my hands shaky as I fumbled with my carts, drop-ins, music beds, and sound effects I’d need for the first segment. Sweat beaded on my forehead and my heart was pounding like a jackhammer. What if Chuck’s right? What if this is some twisted setup to chop me down to size? I mean, this is Neil Rogers we’re talking about, the guy who’s been my radio idol since I first heard him on WINZ back in 1986.

Before Neil, I was just a clueless, “happy-talk morning jock”, spinning Top 40 hits and cracking corny jokes. But Neil? He lit a fire under me, turned me into the sharp-tongued, take-no-prisoners host I had developed into. And now I’m supposed to fill his shoes? I kept glancing at the door, half-expecting Neil to storm in, point at me, and yell, “Get outa’ my chair punk!” I was a nervous wreck, paranoid as hell that I’m about to crash and burn in front of his army of Neilephites.

I’d only been at WIOD for a few months and while I’d made quite a splash, this was the Neil Rogers show we were talking about. I was one of four weekend part-timers, but I was the only one with 15 years of experience in the radio biz, the only one asked to sub for the other hosts, and yes, there was some resentment coming my way from a couple of them. Not to mention the fact that Randi Rhodes hated my guts, but there was a reason for that, which I’ll have to tell you about at some point. I couldn’t shake the feeling that filling in for the great Neil Rogers, might be a setup to watch me fall flat on my face, with Randi and the others snickering in the background.

Neil had been both hot and cold toward me from the start. Management had pumped me up to Neil, the rest of the air staff, so a lot was expected from me from the very beginning. That very first show I did on WIOD, three months earlier, was a gut-wrenching experience. I knew that everyone from the staff was told to check me out, I knew that my mentor, Neil Rogers, was listening that day, and honestly, I was nervous as hell. No, I wasn’t nervous, I was scared to death, and feeling like every word I said was being dissected by the king of talk radio himself.

I flashed back to the Monday after my first weekend shows. I tuned into Neil’s program, my stomach in knots, and then it happened, right there out of the box at the top of his show, Neil tore into me like a buzzsaw, “Did anybody here that disastrous Jaz McKay this past weekend. Oh my God where did Boy Gary find this guy, drunk in some cowboy bar in Davie? And have you seen this guy, with the long hair and a beard, he’s always in dirty blue jeans and a black leather jacket. What is he some kind of Hells Angel or something?”

He went on calling me an uncouth, smelly redneck, a biker with a bad attitude, no business being on the radio in Miami etc. I was crushed, my hero’s words hitting like a sledgehammer to the gut. Then he opened the phone lines, his Neilephite army unleashed, callers ripping me apart, shredding my performance, my voice, my content, my everything, it was crushing, like a public execution on air. There I sat in the living room of my tiny one bedroom apartment in Miami Gardens that day three months ago, heart pounding, palms sweaty, until I couldn’t take it anymore, I grabbed the phone, dialed in, ready to face the fire.

It was the very last segment at the end of Neil’s first hour when he picked up my call, “Well, look who’s on the phone folks, it’s Jaz McKay himself, so Jaz, how’s it going sir?”

“Well, well, well Mr. Rogers, yeah it seems some of my biker brothers called and said you were talkin’ smack about me so I figured you wouldn’t mind sayin’ whatever you gotta’ say directly to me rather than me havin’ to hear about it from a third party,” I shot back, my voice tight with nerves and defiance.

Neil responded in his usual condescending tone, “Jaz, calm down there, I don’t want you pissed off at me, I know you have connections, I wouldn’t want your ‘biker brothers’ to come after me,” his sarcasm slicing through the air like a razor-sharp blade, attempting to cut me down to size on live radio.

“That’s another thing Neil, you suggested I might be a Hells Angel, this is South Florida buddy, this is Outlaw Motorcycle Club territory, and they ain’t friendly to H.A.’s. You trying to get me hurt before my next show this Saturday?” I laughingly snapped, throwing a bit of my own sarcasm back at him.

“No, I don’t know all the biker protocol Jaz, I apologize. So, do you have anything else to add, because I have a hard break here?” he asked, with a his tone softening just a touch.

“Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, anybody out there calling in to Neil Rogers today, trash-talkin’ about me or my show, if you got the guts, call me this Saturday, I’ll be right there from 2 to 6 p.m. You got something to say to me, do it then! See Ya, Neil!” I barked, throwing down the gauntlet.

“Well, okay, Jaz, SEE YA!” he said shouting my own signature ‘parting phrase’ that I always used to say goodbye to a caller. “There you go, folks, Jaz McKay, the newest addition to the WIOD staff, I’ll be right back with your calls after the news,” he said, cutting to break.

When Neil came back at 11:06, the whole vibe shifted, like a storm clearing out of nowhere, Neil started saying great things about me, about how it took guts to call in and confront him and his listeners. He started praising my talent, my voice, my timing and my sense of humor, he said, “Jaz McKay is the best thing to happen at WIOD in a long time, a breath of fresh air, even though that air does reek of pot smoke.”

The callers followed his lead, suddenly they couldn’t wait to hear my next show, saying I brought a raw energy they’d been missing, I went from a crushed cockroach to a phoenix rising from the ashes, ready to set the airwaves on fire that next Saturday afternoon. Neil’s words, the audience’s turnaround, they proved I’d earned my damn spot on WIOD, I wasn’t just some fluke who’d stumbled into South Florida’s talk radio jungle.

From that point on my Saturday and Sunday shows started blowing up, becoming the kind of water cooler talk that had listeners buzzing all week, the Arbitron trend reports didn’t lie, I was spiking hard in the target demos, Men 25&ndash;54 and 35&ndash;64, hell, even the 12+ numbers were climbing faster than a Miami heat wave in June. Suddenly, I was the go-to guy, filling in for everybody, Rick, Suds, Randi, you name it, everybody except the untouchable Neil Rogers. But now, that was all about to change.

So, there I sat, holding the microphone of the number one radio show in all of South Florida about to embark on a dangerous territory, oh yeah did I mention I used a handheld mic at WIOD? It was the classic Sennheiser MD 421, with a little desk stand, but I would hold it, the long cords on both the mic and my headphones, let me walk around the studio as if I was doing standup comedy again. Pacing the stage, riffing off the crowd, except now it was live radio, but I was still stirring the pot with callers and the metaphoric stage was considerably bigger.

As I waited for the show to begin, watching the second hand on the studio clock revolve, I’ll admit that despite my bold exterior ego and appearance of confidence, my eternal insecurity was making me more apprehensive with every second that ticked by. I knew I was about to royally piss off tens of thousands of people who were expecting their beloved Neil Rogers, but instead, they’d get me, a deplorable redneck biker in faded blue jeans, a pair of beat up Tony Lama's, and a sleeveless black T-shirt with the Snaggletooth Motörhead logo. There I was, a guy running on almost no sleep, still reeling from a few hours ago when I was utterly blasted out of my mind, stuffing dollar bills into the garters of the naked pole-dancing babes at one of Miami’s finest, sleazy strip joints. I tried to relax, after all, it’s just radio and it ain’t rocket surgery, right?

The local news followed the network feed and then ended with the weather report; “Partly cloudy and a chance of anxiety, with a high probability of panic, and scattered self-doubt rolling in by for the next four hours,” My gut churning like a Cat 5 hurricane, I braced for the shitstorm I was about to face with the Neilephites, knowing I was about to get drenched in their wrath.

Neil Rogers’ intro music kicked in, followed by the WIOD “Big Voice Guy” with the intro. Every station back then had a Big Voice Guy, a production director with an amazing voice, not some sketchy dude on retainer in Newark or Poughkeepsie with a home studio, banging out hundreds of voice tracks a week, like every station does today.

WIOD had one of the best, I can’t recall his name, but man, what a voice he had, that big booming baritone announced, “News Talk Radio 610 WIOD presents The Neil Rogers Show. To get in touch and talk to Neil, dial 751-WIOD in Dade, in Broward, 524-WIOD, outside the 305 area code, dial toll-free 1-800-944-WIOD, Bell South Mobility customers, make a free call by dialing Star WIOD. The opinions expressed by the guests, hosts, or callers are not necessarily the opinions of this station. Now here’s Neil Rogers on News Talk Radio 610 WIOD!”

I punched in a few drop-ins, a frantic clip from some old movie with a guy yelling, “Oh dear God, it’s beginning!” then a classic Three Stooges bit, Moe barking, “Quiet down, you knuckleheads, I’m broadcasting!” I grabbed the mic, roaring my signature opening, “God Bless America! No, this is not Neil Rogers, it’s your old buddy, Jaz McKay and I'm in charge whether you like it or not!” then I slammed a button, unleashing a woman’s piercing scream, “No, no, not him, he’s trying to kill me!” followed by a raucous sound effect of a small studio audience cheering and clapping like I was hosting a circus. Listeners always thought I had six or seven rowdy folks in the studio with me, but nah, it was just clever sound effects, I did have a few hanger-on’s for my weekend gigs, my buddy’s Victor and Keith and my girlfriend Victoria, but today I was flying solo, just me with Jorge in the control room on the other side of the glass, watching the madness unfold.

As the music faded behind me, I gripped that handheld Sennheiser and leaned in over the consol, laying out the wild circumstances of my morning, “So anyway, there I was, about an hour and a half ago, passed out cold in my bed, when my phone goes off like a nuclear bomb, the ringer's always on high, anyway it’s Jorge over there and he's telling me Neil’s under the weather and he’s requested I drag my sorry ass in, massive hangover and all, to perform on this show like the tap-dancing monkey I am. So here I am, instead of a Best of show, you get ME, can you believe it?”

Jorge jumped in at that point to back me up, confirming I wasn’t spinning some wild yarn, I hadn’t clubbed Neil over the head, stashed him in the prize closet of the promotions department downstairs, he explained that Neil wasn’t feeling one hundred percent that morning, and he was tired of running “Best of shows” all the time_,_in fact, Neil himself had recommended I sit in for him, a nod that made my hung-over heart skip a beat.

I pulled the microphone up to my mouth and said, “Grab your phone, or grab your ankles, whichever gets you off, and call me, you know the numbers, what did you think about that game last night? Those Buffalo Bills looked like absolute crap, I think we’ve got them coming up in about three weeks, the Fins are gonna crush those sorry snowbird bastards. Oh hey, and let me tell you about the epic night I had, I wanna thank Rick Santino, the manager at The Goalpost Grill in Pembroke Pines where we went to watch Monday Night Football, that guy always goes out of his way to take care of his favorite customer and that customer is ME, then I gotta give a shout-out to Amber, Disarray, Sapphire and all the lovely ladies over at Crazy Jims on Hallandale Beach Blvd, that’s where my buddies and I ended up after the Goal Post Grill and brother I didn't get home till about three o'clock this morning, so I ain’t firing on all cylinders right now but let's do this! So what’s on your mind, let’s go to the phones!”

The computer screen showed we had a full bank of calls on hold so off I went, “First up is Kevin in Miami Beach, hey my brother what’s happening?”

Thankfully, Kevin from Miami Beach was buzzing with excitement, “Jaz McKay, it’s great to hear you during the week, man, I listen every Saturday, Sunday, when I heard you filling in for Neil, I couldn’t believe it, I mean, I love Neil, but if he’s not feeling well, or going out of town, I’d much rather hear you fill in for him.” Kevin was a damn good first caller that day, he really set the table so I was feeling pretty solid at this point, the hangover haze lifting a bit, I thanked him, “Appreciate your checking in, brother, and you’re a real one man,” then moved on to the next caller, ready to keep the fire going.

That was pretty much how the rest of the show rolled, most callers were solid and supportive, doing their job like champs, see, callers have a the most important role on the show. In talk radio callers have a job to do, whether they know it or not, they’re there to make the host sound good, that’s their role, that’s the whole point of taking calls, they’re part of the show, keeping it flowing, giving it rhythm, whether they’re telling wild stories, making an obscene noise and hanging up, telling jokes, reciting a poem, they can be funny, irreverent, pissed off, or just crazy as a loon. Even the ones itching to spout off at me for being a hardcore, proud American, flag waving redneck have a role to play. I held my own too; firing back at them with the same grit I brought to every mic I ever touched.

Then as quickly as it started it was over. That four hours flew by faster than a Miami summertime thunderstorm, I was just about to cross the finish line when I saw the hotline was lighting up. Jorge answered it and looked through the glass at me and nodded as if he was telling the caller “Yes, hold on.” That’s when he put it on hold. The hotline, reserved for station employees only, I was immediately a little nervous, was the call for me? Anytime the hotline rings at the end of your show it’s usually the boss, and it’s never good news.

Right then, the bumper music kicked in, signaling thirty seconds till the end of the show, I pulled the mic to my mouth, “Okay, all you sick, disgusting freaks, that’s it for me, you heard it straight from Neil’s pie hole, next time he’s out, I’ll be right here, so get used to it, Rick, Suds are up next, I’ll SEE YA!”

I said talking up the ramp of the top of the hour music bed and into the legal ID then with a kind of smirk on his face Jorge keyed the talkback mic and told me to pick up the hotline.

“Okay, who is it?” I asked.

“Just pick it up,” Jorge replied, his tone cryptic.

I reluctantly picked up the receiver in the studio and said hello, then I heard the voice on the other end, it all clicked.

“Hey, Jaz,” the voice said, “it’s Neil, you must’ve been freaked out when Jorge called you this morning.”

I nearly dropped the phone, “Yeah I was, how you feeling, Neil?”

“I’m right as rain, I just wanted to see how you’d handle the pressure, you did good, you biker trash redneck,” he said, a snicker in his voice.

“Well, thanks Neil, I guess,” I replied, laughing, relief washing over me.

“If I need you again, I’ll have Jorge call with more lead time in the future, oh, and Jaz?”

“Yeah?”

“You really did a good job, now get outta here, go grab a beer at your favorite strip club.”

“I think I will,” I said, grinning.

“See Ya, Jaz!”

“See Ya, Neil.”

Following that initial experience, I had the distinct pleasure of stepping in for Neil on several occasions over the course of the next year. Whether it was covering for him during his vacations, taking over on his scheduled days off, or stepping up when he was under the weather, I was always ready to lend a hand whenever Neil needed me. Let’s be honest, I did it for selfish reasons, the money, the experience and for the huge audience, but it was also a real honor to support him and ensure everything ran smoothly in his absence. Each opportunity to fill in felt like a privilege, and I cherished the trust he placed in me during those times.

Looking back, that day was a turning point, I’d gone from a hung-over mess, terrified of the Neilephites, to earning the man’s respect, his call wasn’t just a pat on the back, it was a green light to keep pushing, keep kicking the hornets’ nest. I walked out of WIOD that day, still a redneck biker in a Motörhead T-shirt, but now I was a redneck biker who’d held his own in Neil Rogers’ world, ready for whatever the airwaves threw at me next. That day at WIOD wasn’t just a win, it was a sacred moment, a nod from the King of South Florida radio that told me I belonged in that very elite club of talk radio hosts, who leave a mark, good or bad.

When I heard Neil had passed away, back in 2010, it hit me like a freight train, not only had we lost a true radio legend, but the guy who’d shaped me more than anyone else in this crazy ass business. He was my mentor, my inspiration and the reason I’d ditched my Top 40 happy-talk shtick back in 1987 and found my real voice on the radio.

I can still hear Neil’s razor-sharp wit, his snicker at an unexpected quip, the quiet pride I felt when he’d borrow my “See Ya” sign-off, but above all, I remember his unshakable confidence. He was the living embodiment of “never let ‘em see you sweat,” a trait that defined Neil Rogers, and is etched into my brain as the gold standard of what a talk radio host should be.

Neil Rogers made me better at my craft, his lessons etched into every mic I’ve touched since, a guiding light through the chaos of the radio airwaves, reminding me to always rock the boat, no matter the severity of the storm. “Neil, God!”

# Neil Rogers on MySpace

_Recovered MySpace posts by Neil Rogers (January 2007)_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Neil Rogers MySpace Posts

### beasly

First, let me apologize to my listeners for the music on the show...but my patience with Joe Bell and the Beasleys is near an end. They have stubbornly refused to do anything to support my show, and the technical nightmare that's been going on is just part of it. In all my years in the business I have never encountered anyone like "Jolly" Joe Bell....he will agree with everything you say, and proceed to do NOTHING. For those of you who think the crank callers are funny, you'll have to tune in elsewhere to hear them. For these next two years(THE END) I will do the show the way I want....with OR without calls. It would be like writing a book to go thru all the insane things these people have done...suffice it to say they are pathetic. Amazingly, they consider themselves real broadcasters---I know, hold your laughter. Anyway, as of Tuesday, I'm going back to doing the show I believe in doing--with or without Joe Bell's help. He is joly..and very full of shit. A real PAPER TIGER. joyce Fitch in Naples is running the show...farts and all. Have a great day!!!! Neil

### myspace phantoms

AS long as I'm on this....maybe some of you know those two phantom "friends" I had on here who both played me like a violin. Be interested in hearing. The first of course was Jacob Voth, 32, who allegedly lives in the Nob Hill-Cleary area in Plantation and sells Health Insurance. The other "HUH" claimed his real first name was Brice...a high school senior...I think in Deerfield, Delray, or Boca. Anybody know these people???????

### this space

Guess what?! I changed my mind. Thanks to Mat with one T, and new friend on here. In checking out his friends, I discovered Mark...the university of North Fla soccer player and male model. All I can say is...HOLY SHIT!!!! Screw Jacob...Mark is well on his way to being in my will....just for being ALIVE!!! Imagine...a living and breathing YOUNG guy in Florida......Maybe Mat will arrange an online matchup...strictly for VERBAL intercourse purposes. This site can be as much fun as you want it to be. Just don't become addicted and take it for what it is. Never assume too much about the people you're talking to unless you know them. As far as the Beasleys and Joe Bell are concerned, THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND WON'T GET ANY SMARTER. I'll show up every day and do MY show the way I believe in doing it! In closing, MARK GOD!!!MMMMMMMMMMM..............!!!!!

### ASSHOLES

Must admit, Wednesday's show was great fun for me. We had a remarkable response on this site, and it was like a part0time job to reply to everyone when I got home.....but I enjoyed it. Lots of really neat people out there. DON'T WORRY...the show isn't going to be taken over by all MySpace talk...but it's more fun than screaming about this floppy-eared lunatic GW Bush who is right now talking pure, unadulterated BULLSHIT!! More deaths, more maimngs, more wasted lives....FOR WHAT??? Enough of that for now. Bottom line to this entry...there are many ASSHOLES out there..with NO LIVES...who will totally twist around what I'm doing on MySpace. TOO BAD!!! I'm not trolling for sex, for boyfriends, for naked pictues, etc. This has become lots of fun for me and a chance to interact with lots of listeners. If any asshole wants to conjure up other shit....GET A LIFE!! I'm not stupid OR desperate. As far as the previous entry about Jacob and HUH....let me say this----it's amazing that nobody in my VAST audience knows either of these people. I know Jacob is for real....I know him. As far as Brice(HUH)..who knows. But I'm sure that if he is for real, he is reading this blog every day. In that case, it would be nice to do the decent thing--put me back on as a "friend" open up the profile again, and let me know when you want to hear from my grumpy old ass. That would be the considerate thing to do....IF YOU ARE FOR REAL.........if this was all just a big tease...or trap...or whatever...I'm sure there will be no response. VERY SAD. And for those of you who want to lecture me about "letting go" etc....mind your own business!!!! I will admit I think I went way overboard on emailing Mark, the UNF Soccer guy....but who cares?! He probably has no idea who I am, and I will never email anybody on here FIRST..BAD IDEA!!! Anyhow, thanks for the amazing response today...we have 1018 "friends" at last count..not bad for this old queen in a venue designed for YOUNG people. As Jacob's ex-neighbor Joe said after that gruesome experience...this whole thing I think has brought me closer to the audience! THWEET~~~~~~

_January 10, 2007_

### bulletin

BULLETIN!!!!!!! It is 10pm on Wednesday night,c and I just got an email reply from Mark, the UNF soccer player. What a nice kid. Flattered by the attention. Here I go sounding like the ugly girl who just got invited to the prom by the star HS quarterback, but what a HOOT!!! See, I told you...I did the right thing by sending that email....LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!

_January 10, 2007_

### this site

Man, I am really pissed!!!!! This damn MySpace is WORSE than crack.....and I am definitelt not cur out for it. First..thanks to the MANY MANY listeners who have used this as a way of saying thanks for all the years of entertainment, etc. That's been great. But the rest of my experience on here has made me borderline NUTS!!! As soon as you ask for a bit of information about these guys...so you can feel certain who you're chatting with...the games begin. The couldn't give a SHIT less about me as a person. These are groupies....which is OK. But PLEASE don't put on an act for me and pretend to be a friend. Every time i think I have made a real on,ine friend on here, the games begin. My opinion is that...sure, lots of people will get laid from this site--that's fine. But if you think you will EVER make a real friend by chatting with people on here..YOU ARE DREAMING!!!! I'm fed up with it. The site will stay..the response has been amazing. BUT...no more delusions for me. I haven't encountered even one person on here whom I can call a friend..even of the online variety. I had a fabulous life BEFORE MySpace. My opinion has varied along with my experiences on here. But I won't be changing my opinion again. THis thing has made a wreck out of me(and lots of others). I am absolutely WILD over the way some of these people play their games....the disappearing acts...not reading your messages, etc. WHO THE HELL NEEDS THIS?? If I want to see beautiful young guys, I can walk outside onto the streets of Toronto. I never intended to get involved with this site..but then Jacob...and HUh..and now others...you all know the story. Enough of the BS.....I will answer the listeners and pay some attention to this, but no more psychosis. Even the people you thought you could trust are full of shit on here. Sorry, but MySpace is primarily for kids and OVERGROWN CHILDREN.....GOOD LUCK!!!! Neil

### this site, Part II

I didn't really complete my thoughts earlier....the steam is still coming out of my ears. If I was on this site trolling for sex or looking to play games with people, then I'd deserve what I get. But the thing that gets me is that every one of these guys claims to love the show..listened for years..etc etc. Then what is to be gained by screwing with my emotions??? Why send somebody dozens of friendly emails and then DISAPPEAR"" For what??? I guess it makes for good conversation with their buddies...like junior high school locker room pranks. PLEASE get me out of this. There are many many really nice people on our site, but for me the fun is gone...it is now debilitating. It's easy to say "quit doing this" but the alleged sincerity of these people gets me every time. I'll say it again..Making an ONLINE FRIEND ON MYSPACE IS LIKE FINDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS CASH IN YOUR BACKYARD...FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! Pissed off and fired up.....

_January 14, 2007_

### ALL CLEAR

This...I PROMISE..will be the last time you read the kind of neurotic posts you saw here last night. One of my biggest weaknesses is impatience. Combine that with having been burned badly twice on here already and you have the ingredients for really psychotic behavior. It is very hard to develop trust of people on here...they are reluctant to give proof of who or what they are. But late last night and this morning I got two long, neat emails from my two best online buddies plus made a new friend on here as well. I keep telling you "Don'y take this site too seriously"..etc. And then I go nuts myself. Call last night a bad "hiccup" in my involvement with this thing. Won't happen again. Like I've told you..life is good here...no complaints....although we finally have snow on the ground today. When I hear the nightmares that some other people have been thru on here, I consider myself VERY LUCKY. I hear from some really teriffic people on here everyday and appreciate it. Back to enjoy a well-deserved(lol) day off!!! Later, the world's oldest teenaged girl...NEIL

### tech problem

Well here we go sportsfans...Another crank...Ethan, with all the nearly nude pics, turns out to be a crank and has removed his fake profile. No problem there, but now I get home and the SEND feature looks like its sending out my emails, but it is not!! And they do NOT show up in the SENT column....???? Evidently, this faker has done something to screw up our site. If you don't get a reply from your email tonite(Wed, 1/17) its because my replies don't go out. Incoming seems fine. ANY IDEAS????? Thanks, Neil

_January 17, 2007_

### tech part II

The bad news is all sending AND receiving are down on MySpace....Thanks to our computer maven Eric for tracking this down. At least it wasn't that crank du jour Ethan screwing with us. As far as he is concerned I have only one comment...HUH????????

_January 17, 2007_

### tech III

It's 11:30pm.....a few of your emails are getting thru, but none of mine are going out. Sorry, but I can't reply until they unscrew this MySpace ....GOING TO BED!!!

### still cant send

Sorry guys but still having tech issues with MySpace....I can get SOME of your messages by my replies do NOT go thru. 8:45 Thurs am and no change! Anybody have ideas?? Let me know Thanks, Neil

_January 18, 2007_

### nutjob

Thanks to a notorious chronic nutjob(who posed as Huh,Ethan ,etc) and sent complaints for spam violations, we still can't respond to your messages. TOO MANY GAMEPLAYERS AND LUNATICS OUT THERE........especially ONE!! Anyway, keep the messages and posts coming..I read them all. Hopefully, we'll be back to normal soon, after we're "INVESTIGATED"!!!! Oy!!!!!!!

_January 19, 2007_

# Interview with Radio Ink (January 2014)

I was interviewed by Radio Ink in January 2014 regarding the NEIL Audio Restoration Project. The interview was never published and the “reporter” never returned follow up emails. Here is the interview assembled from that email thread.

_by Michael Allen Smith - February 17, 2016_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Interview with Radio Ink

Who's behind keeping the memory of Neal alive? Why?

FYI it is spelled NEIL, not Neal.

The community of those of us keeping the memories of Neil Rogers alive are on The Neil Rogers Facebook group. Members of the group not only include fans that listened to Neil throughout his 33-year career in Miami, but the group also includes people that worked with Neil.

Once we had this audio, at first it was placed on a file-sharing site for download. Others stepped forward with more audio to share. Then YouTube announced it would no longer cap uploads to 15 minutes. At that point, all the shows went up in their entirety. That attracted more fans, several of which had more audio to share.

The project started with 60 shows from 1999 and now has over 1,700 shows going back to 1987. As more people find the shows, I expect more audio will be located and shared.

What have you put together? A website? FB page, etc.

We have a website (NeilRogers.org), YouTube channel, a Facebook Group, Twitter, Flickr for photos, Google+ and even Pinterest.

How many people engage in all of this?

On an average month the videos on YouTube get 15,000 views. In 2013, over 2.5 million minutes were listened to just on YouTube. This doesn't include MP3 downloads. The Facebook group has over 1,600 members.

What feedback do you get?

People love discovering old Neil Rogers shows that were assumed to have been lost forever. I myself can listen to shows broadcasted years before I discovered the show.

In addition to those who believed Neal was a great broadcaster, there were many others who say he was the meanest person they ever met. What are your thoughts on that?

I never met NEIL, so I can't answer that question.

How long do you plan to keep this going?

When Eric Harold died there was no backup procedure in place. I also saw how the Bob Lassiter fans were left hanging when the Airchecks site lost all their audio. I made sure that wouldn't happen with the Neil Rogers Audio Restoration Project. We have a document shared with core individuals with accounts, passwords, and detailed instructions on what to do should any of us ever step away from the project. Also, all the shows are backed up in at least 5 places — not counting downloads — so there is almost zero risk of audio loss.

# 📄Neil Rogers 2016 Radio Hall of Fame Induction

_by Michael Allen Smith - December 21, 2016_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > Neil Rogers 2016 Radio Hall of Fame Induction

In 2016 Neil Rogers was inducted into the [National Radio Hall of Fame](https://www.radiohalloffame.com/neil-rogers). The [acceptance speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZp_9jOA6Ys) was delivered by his long time producer Jorge Rodriguez.

> Thank you thank you Scott Shannon. Neil used to say never trust anybody with two first names. OK, boy it's tough tough crowd. Don't worry I'm not going to talk for a long time so don't freak out. I'm not going to read Neil's Wikipedia entry you can and the literature that you have there is all pretty accurate for the most part. Not everything but nevertheless.
> I just want to say that you know Neil would have been 74 the 5th of this month and on the 4th which was a Friday I do my internet humble little internet radio show what you can hear on sofloradio.com. And around his birthday we like to celebrate and wax nostalgic about the good old days and on this particular show I was joined by Joe Castello, my backup producer, who produced Neil's show if I was not available and produced my show if I sat in for Neil under the Beasley regime at WQAM. We were also joined by Brit Somers formerly known as Boca Brian soundsmith extraordinaire — who assembled the audio clip that we're about to hear — and as we're listening to it and it was very poignant nostalgic for us we agreed that many of the people in the room probably wouldn't get it because not something Neil…the Neil show is not something that you can get in three or four minutes.
> Indeed it took me the better part of a month as his producer before I figured out what was going on. It sounded like just mean man insulting everything and everyone. Callers calling up and kissing his butt. Neil would insult them for doing so and then they would call back. So it didn't sound like a radio show. To me it sounded like madness but people say it's oh it's an acquired taste. I've heard people say that it's an acquired taste but I think that more accurately describes something that you get used to like Limburger or something as opposed to a joke that you're not getting or that you're not in on, until you are, until you do, and then you get it and then you're hooked.
> It was vaudeville. It was live spontaneous vaudeville complete with slapstick and pratfalls, pies in your face and Neil was the one throwing pies and throwing banana peels out there and it was very spontaneous. As matter of fact I've never worked on a show that had less planning. I can't imagine a show that has less planning because we didn't plan the show at all and the hour or so before the show Neil and I would discuss all the things that we wouldn't be able to discuss on the show because when you're doing stream-of-consciousness you never know what's gonna come falling out of your mouth and get you in trouble. So I would tell people if you like Neil show you think that Neil is brave and acerbic and you know a lot of balls during his show, you should hear that the pre-show — that's the real show, but it was it was brave.
> He was a very brave man we didn't screen the calls at all or very little. If I did answer the phones it was just to ask what city they were calling from so that they would have a point of reference. I've worked on other shows where the call screening was was so intense that it was practically an orchestrated situation.
> Neil didn't fear what a caller would say. He didn't care. He was going to get the best of them. They weren't going to get the best of him. He was that quick and everything was a setup he had to come back for everything and if you did set him up intentionally in vaudeville fashion it was magical. It was very flattering when he would set me up and allow me to deliver the punch line. I was very honored when he would do that.
> South Florida is a mixed bag of nuts. A great big bag of mixed nuts. Those of us who live there, we live there on purpose. We're free to leave and and yet there we are. So obviously we like something about it, but there's a lot about South Florida frustrates us and Neil would take those sources of frustration and like straw spin it into comedy gold. It made it less bad because it gave us the ability to laugh at the things that were bothering us. When it was the bridges being stuck in the up position or anything else that was very unique to South Florida. If you've ever lived in South Florida or visited South Florida you might know what I'm talking about.
> It was a magical time. For over 30 years Neil emceed what was going on there. It was a giant round-table discussion that included everybody who had the nerve and was brave enough or crazy enough to call in and enter the atmosphere that Neil maintained and presided over. It was an atmosphere of quality. He had very high standards for what went on on his show and I was honored to be up to those standards. He was already very popular by the time I joined the show for the last 19 years of it and I'm just happy that Neil felt that I was worthy enough to stay there with him to the end.
> The clip that you're about to hear was assembled by Boca Brit formerly Boca Brian and if you enjoy it half as much as I do that means that I'll be enjoying it twice as much as you. Roll it!

After the video played, Scott Shannon and Jorge Rodriguez complete the Neil Rogers portion of the ceremony.

> (Scott Shannon) Ladies and gentlemen into the National Radio Hall of Fame: Mr. Neil Rogers and accepting Jorge Rodriguez.
> (Jorge Rodriguez) Thank you. On behalf of Neil I want to thank the South Florida audience, the people who contributed to the show, producers like Joe Castello, Miguel Escobar and people that were responsible for a lot of the audio production on the show KJ, Adam “Guitar Man” Austin, Mitch Lewis and of course the world's greatest parodist and songsmith Boca Brian who now lives abroad as Boca Brit Sommers. Thank you very much and Boca you deserve a piece of this. I'm gonna put it in my studio and so when you come over next time I might let you touch it and the award too.

# Chronic Review - Alfred "Al" Rogers

Overview of WIOD chronic - Alfred "Al" Rogers

_by AK - July 25, 2013_

Thursday Midday Story: Chronic Review - Alfred “Al” Rogers

Many of you’ve seen him in here.. I have him blocked, (so I won’t be able to see any of his responses).. but I recommend most of you do the same.

See, unlike [The Guy With The Eyes (TGWTE)](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/the-guy-with-the-eyes) or the [Fanny Pack Guy (TFPG)](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/the-fanny-pack-guy), no one really understood his modus operandi until it was far too late.

With TGWTE, you knew he was angry, perturbed, semi-hostile, and loved every minute of it from the moment you saw him. And FPG was what he was.. just a happy go lucky Neil fanatic.

But with Al, … Al’s an entirely different sort of douchebag altogether.

“Al’s an entirely different sort of douchebag”

Thanks.

Al started showing up at Neil events before I even started probably. And so when I get there, I just saw him as some Neilie. And struck up a few conversations along the way. He SEEMED normal.. except for that shock of dark curly hair and that 70’s “porn star” mustache.

But he was, unlike lot of the chronics, able to hold down a conversation, ask questions, provide answers to questions you asked.. like a normal human being.

I started to notice he was showing up at events more and more… Dade, Broward, Palm Beach… didn’t matter. Hell, even Fat Rich did that. Until I noticed one day as I was packing the van to leave that he didn’t get into his car… he climbed onto a scooter. And not a pimped out one.. like a moped almost.

And it struck me as REALLY odd that this guy would not only travel across multiple counties in order to stand around for 2 hours at a Neil appearance, but that he must have spent at LEAST that amount of time traveling to GET THERE and go home. I mean, who has 5 hours to dedicate to watching a local radio personality sit at a table and sign things and drink Snapple?

I was getting PAID for it and I barely had enough time. But, as usual, I digress… He never showed up with anyone. We just all assumed he was a really lonely sad guy, so down on his luck he either couldn’t afford a car, or gas, or had some kind of legal troubles that prevented him from owning a car.

Once Randi started, and I moved out of the promotions gig into her producer’s chair, things got a little more ramped up and strange. He started showing up at the Randi events too. He’d show up and stand next to the table where Randi sat, and not leave… like he was part of the crew, talking to people like he was somehow involved. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he offered people his autograph. And he started calling her show. And often, because he’d be one of the 2 callers to the show, I’d put him on the air. They seemed to hit it off…he was weird, and loved Randi, and Randi loved Randi, and liked weird people…so it just fit. Besides… with only her mom on the other line, killing 5 minutes of airtime with Al was as good a way to do it as any.

But then…Al would show up at places that weren’t even public appearances. Like Randi would say offhandedly that she and Jim were eating dinner at their regular hole-in-the-wall pizza shack around the corner from their house, and god-damn if Al didn’t show up. Or Randi would say “I’m going bowling with my the lovely friend (whateverhername was) at Don Carter”, and sure as scooter Al would show up. It was like he not only thought he was part of her show, he thought he was part of her inner circle.

I’ve heard rumor that Randi filed a restraining order, but I don’t know anything about that. I know she had to file several at different points, but I don’t know if Al was one of them.

What I do know is that no matter where Neil or Randi went, you could always count on hearing the put-put-put of a scooter pulling up at Specs, or Pizza Loft, or Peaches, or Barnes and Noble or whatever. He was ALWAYS there.

And for those of you who haven’t blocked him yet, you’ll notice he still is.

Here’s what I remember him looking like: (photo missing)

# Almost Killed Jorge

A tale involving radio producer Jorge Rodriguez.

_by AK - September 4, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Almost Killed Jorge

Friday Afternoon Horror Story: The time I could have killed Jorge, and ruined his vacation.

I’m not being humorous.. Nor am I speaking figuratively as if I was really mad at him… I mean I actually, sincerely, literally nearly killed my best buddy and Neil Rogers’ producer, Jorge.

Jorge was someone I kinda looked up to. He was older, had a full-time gig, was very smart, witty, and had a taste for things I hadn’t been exposed a lot to,, He’d lived in Cuba, Montana, was a repo man, carried a pocket lock-picking case, smoked stogies like a 60 year old, had the biggest mullet I’d ever seen, and was the most organized guy in the world. So as a young 23 yr old just getting into the business, being invited to hang out with him was a real gift of sorts. He even tried to expose me to Dungeons and Dragons by inviting me over and letting me participate unsuccessfully in a game with some friends. I didn’t understand it at ALL. Hell, I still don’t get it.

Someone in Jorge’s family had a cabin in the mountains of North Carolina. Cabin.. It’s like a 3 story house cut into the hillside with the top floor overlooking the mountains, valleys and lakes. And when Jorge said he was going on vacation and asked me to go with, I said “Hell fuckin’ yeah!”

Just 2 guys.. Manly men.. Driving into the mountains of North Carolina to go fishin’ and hiking’ and drinkin’ and burnin’.

He scheduled his vacation, and I asked for those 5 days in a row off. As a part timer, I really didn’t get the luxury of either vacation days or determining my schedule, but since Marvin was a buddy too, he permitted it. And the trip was planned. We’d drive up early in the morning getting there early evening. Spend the night, the next 3 days and nights, then drive home; a nice 5 day vacation.

3 days before the trip, my wisdom tooth got impacted and I had it removed. But I was fine. I had a few pills (good for the road trip!) but mostly, it didn’t bother me at all.

The day before the trip, I got a sore throat. Not gonna stop ME!

The morning of, at 5am, on about 4 hours sleep, I head to Jorge’s house in Pembroke Pines, and we load the car with his stuff, and hit I-95 North. And I am PSYCHED!

Jorge has with him a container of cuban coffee, a box of glazed Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and other assorted sticky, sweet things of the green variety, if you know what I’m saying. And I start pounding cuban coffees, stuffing my gullet with about 4 doughnuts, and partaking of “all these things”.. And I’m WIRED on sugar and coffee like you wouldn’t imagine. I hadn’t ever had café cubano, but boy was it strong and sweet and went great with the rest of the stuff I was rapidly imbibing. I was feeling a little warm, but I assumed it was from the hot coffee and not related to the sore throat at all… and I didn’t care… nothing was gonna slow me down at all…

Except…

When fishing around in my mouth for donut remains with my tongue I stuck it into the hole left from the wisdom tooth, every synapse in my skull fired off simultaneously, and I took a nap.

Did I mention I was driving?

The next thing I know, Jorge is hovering over me from the passenger seat. We’re on the inside shoulder of I95. And Jorge is screaming at me. “ADAM! HEY! WAKE UP!”

After he’d noticed we were drifting between lanes, with the pedal pressed to the floor, he saw me with my eyes rolled up, convulsing, put it into neutral, grabbed the wheel until we coasted to our resting point. And apparently when you pass out, your body wants to lie down to equalize your blood pressure, and if it cant, you convulse as your body tries desperately to shake you off whatever is keeping you up, like a driver’s seat and steering wheel. I was told it wasn’t pretty…

“Maybe you should drive”

Ya think?

So I got in the passenger seat, tried desperately not to vomit, and drive with Jorge and I headed north in relative silence for a long while. I apologized many many times, explaining about the wisdom teeth, lack of sleep, the cold coming on, the sugar, caffeine and other additives…

When we got to the cabin I was really amazed. The place was beautiful. Sparsely decorated, with lots of wood everywhere… I was also exhausted. So I climbed into the cot on the ground level and told Jorge I really needed to sleep. And in no time at all, I was snoring. Around 3am I woke up shivering uncontrollably.. Partially from being sick, but mostly because it was 40 degrees in the bottom of the house, up against the stone of the mountain… I couldn’t wake Jorge at 3am for blankets.. So I curled in a ball under the thin blanket I had and tried as best I could to shake myself asleep.

The next day, bright and early, Jorge was up, and so was I. He was really excited to show me around, go fishing, take a hike through the most beautiful forrest with the leaves changing colors. There was only one problem.

My spine felt like it had been a glass rod, that had shattered into a hundred shards, and any movement by my legs, hips, arms or neck was insufferably painful. Between the black out convulsions, the fever, the relentless shivering from the cold, I was incapacitated beyond belief.,, but I felt so bad for Jorge and I didn’t want to ruin his vacation so I did the best we could. We stood in the icy river up to our knees and unsuccessfully fished for trout. We hiked through the woods and up hills and down valleys, Jorge waiting patiently for me to catch up. At one point on a darkened trail through the woods we came across a family of deer. As miserable as it was, I was still pretty glad to be there. It was awesome… I only wished I’d felt up to take on this place 100%, and I was operating at about a 15% capacity.

The next day Jorge showed me the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and Grandfather Mountain. He climbed the tower at the top and I took it all in as much as I was able to.

And before we knew it, the vacation was over, and we were driving home.

Jorge drove.

# The Great Briefcase Robbery

The Rick Reilly briefcase story.

_by AK - October 23, 2013_

Wednesday Afternoon Bed Time Story: The Great Briefcase Robbery

This one is kinda fuzzy.. I don’t have all the specifics.. and some of this stuff may be coming from things I’d learned afterwards, or that I’ve made up in my head since based on other real things that may or may not have happened.. so take it for what it’s worth. Rick, and or Suds may remember differently, but my guess is since they couldn’t remember anything in 1991, that by now it’s as forgotten as.. uhm..something else I cant remember. But I THINK this is how I remember it all going down…

Back when I was still a part-timer, a total flunkie, splitting my whopping 29.5 hours per week for $4.25 per hour between board-opping and the Promotions Department, I would frequently help out Rick and Suds, or Neil, because frankly, at the ripe old age of 21 and fresh out of college, I was a HUGE fan of theirs, and it’s why I even applied there.

And even as a nobody, poor slob, they would let me do things like tag along with Marvin on a pay phone challenge, or sit in the control room with Jorge and eat free food Neil had gotten while I did promotions prep.

One day, during Rick and Suds afternoon fun-festival, as I sat in the control room watching Marvin run the board and Rick and Suds doing their show, they decided to do an edition of the Trading Post.

For those of you not in the know, The Trading Post works this way: Rick and Suds offer a prize of minimal value. A caller calls in willing to trade it. They then offer THAT item, until someone ELSE calls in willing to trade for THAT item. And so on, and so on, until Rick and Suds have something really cool that they want. Today they were hoping for a boat.

So they ask Marvin what’s around they can give away (usually they had tickets to things they had to give away for clients) but on this particular day, Marvin informs them that they don’t have anything.

So they ask me to go to the WIOD Prize Closet, which was basically a janitors closet where we kept paper, and autograph cards, and banners, and pens and highlighters, and tickets. Halcyon and I were usually the only people to go in there, and it was right next to her desk, right outside the offices of Boy Gary the Program Director and Kurt “The Evil Twin” the Promotions Director.

So I trod off to the closet, and low and behold… there’s noting in there but old t-shirts that I think I can offer. I walk back to the studio and tell Marvin, who tells Rick and Suds on the air.

“Surely there must be other things in there” says Rick.

“There’s like office supplies. And banners. And some other junk in there” I say.

“Like?”

“There’s like some old briefcase in there….”

“OOOOH!” says Rick.

“Probably Boy Gary’s” says Suds.

“Go see what’s in it, and bring it back” Says Rick.

So, dutifully, I got back to the prize closet.

“Whatcha looking for?” asks Halcyon.

“Rick and Suds are doing the Trading Post. They’re looking for a prize to start them off. Who’s briefcase is in there?”

“I don’t really know. Its been there forever” she says not looking up from her computer.

“Okay” I say and grab it off the top shelf, and open it. There’s truly just assorted junk in it. Some old, used and abused yellow hilighters, old autograph cards from when The Bird was still part of Neil’s show, some napkins, a paper plate, a cart or 2 without labels, a few packets of mustard, and assorted papers. I grabbed it and brought it to Rick.

“I think it’s an old briefcase of Neil’s, but I dunno for sure. There’s only junk really in it. Looks like it’s been in there a long time, too. It was all the way on the top shelf with stuff piled on it”

He rifled thru it much the way I did. Quickly. Reciting what he saw on air to Suds. It seemed non-threatening enough.. So Rick offered it up as “what MIGHT be Neil Roger’s briefcase”, and the Trading Post began.

Neil must have not been listening, because the idea that they might be giving away his briefcase didn’t seem to bother him. If it had, he would have called the batline immediately.

So they give the briefcase away.

The next day, Neil finds out about it and goes ballistic on air. “RICK RILEY STOLE MY GODDAM BRIEFCASE AND GAVE IT TO A GODDAM LISTENER!??!?!? WHAT THE FREAK IS GOING ON IN THIS ASYLUM?!”

And it became fodder for the show. Later that day, the guy who’d won the briefcase called in to go over some of the contents; he’d heard Neil go nuts apparently.

“I think this is an old contract of his in here” says the caller.

After hearing what had happened and how I’d played a part in it, I made sure to show up at the station for the fallout. In the control room, I swallowed hard and looked at Rick. “Uh oh” I said to Marvin, who was nearly in tears laughing. Rick couldn’t believe it either.

During the break, I went into the studio and professed that I had definitely NOT seen that. Only the mustard packs, carts, napkins, plates, old autograph cards and highlighters.

“Listen.. “ says Rick. “I didn’t see it either. We both looked. We weren’t even sure if it WAS Neil’s briefcase. You said it yourself nobody knew who’s it was. It was in the PROMOTIONS CLOSET, for a long time. How important could it have been to Neil if he left it in THERE??”

“Hmmm.. I guess ya got me there. Yeah, yer right. “ I said.

The next morning, the barrage by Neil over the briefcase incident was permanently solidified into everyone’s fondest or least fondest remembrances when Guitar Man called in and recorded that iconic song.

# The “Best” of Randi Rhodes

WIOD story about Randi Rhodes.

_by AK - October 18, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > The “Best” of Randi Rhodes

You asked for it.. So don’t be mad that it’s long…

Friday Midday bedtime story: The “Best” of Randi Rhodes was the Worst of Randi Rhodes.

Its not going to be a short story… and it’s not going to be pretty either.

Reader beware.

There may be some who disagree with how I remember this era, most noticeably Jim and Randi.. but trust me. This is all absolutely 100% true from my perspective.

I’d gotten the Randi producer gig after they’d courted me behind the scenes for months, finally gotten their original producer kicked off the show, tried unsuccessfully to get Jim the job, and the Program Director convinced me to take it even though I’d declined the first offer.

From day one, I made some good decisions and changes to the show. I’d replaced the random rock song open of the hour with a specific piece of music that set a tone, and used it as the out music at the top of the hour to give Randi the opportunity to “play it out”, hitting the post, and ramping out to the break. I’d done a parody song (“Randi My Queen” to Mississippi Queen by Mountain”). Replaced all her music beds with more current, or classic 80’s rock. And Randi loved it. She affectionately, regularly, proudly professed on air and off that I was, in that jewy NY accent that the used to have before she started posing as a political elitist as “Huh ProDOOOS-huh”

And I’d be ratcheting up the cranks for Randy to shoot down like clay pigeons. I’d hang up on the chronics when they became to chronicky.

Jim didn’t have a job. Well, not one that he got paid for, anyway. Jim was Randi’s “Do-Boy”. He would run to the store. He would be the one to calm her when she was having a freak out over some issue and was pulling out her eye lashes (yes, she really would do that when nervous or fussy). He was the one to do any of the monotonous, daily tasks most have to do so that Queen Cersi, err… Randi could continue to relax and get ready for her show. I really don’t know what they did all day, every day. And I really didn’t want to. My role was producing the radio show. Editing. Production. Prepping stuff she might think was interesting. Dealing with pulling copy for live spots, Carting up promos, etc.

Every time Randi did anything, Jim filmed it. Soon, Jim had hooked up with a guy he met who I think was a listener named Jean-Paul who was a videographer for a local TV station, and got him to start filming things on his own time. Foreigner came in and played live in studio (on an AM station??), Kipp Winger came in and performed live, Jean-Paul and Jim filmed it.

When it came time to do our Camillas House/Center One promotion (usually it started getting talked about late July… it took weeks of producing and editing those audio tapes to be sent off to the production house in order to get them back in time for the Autumn sell) Randi and Jim said they wanted to do a best of video.

“Of what?” asked Mgmt. “Randi sitting in a studio?”

But Jim and Randi convinced Mgmt that they had a plan, to leave it to them, they had it all taken care of. They probably assumed it would fall through the cracks and they wouldnt have to do anything Randi for the charity.

I declined to be involved.

“I’m a radio producer. You want audio edited? I’m your guy. You want parody songs? You want audio pulled from the show? Count me in. But this? No thanks.”

And they were relentless. Trying to guilt me into it. Taking shots at me on and off the air about my being her part-time producer. “Marvin is helping Rick and Suds. Jorge is doing Neil’s” theyd say.

“They’re editing bits together and show audio. It takes them a week or so to do. This ain’t that.” I’d say.

And now they’re scheduling and event at a nightclub so Randi can sing “Backstabbers” with a band so they can film it. She’s playing the song on the air and singing along with it. I assume it’s me she’s singing about, tho she says it’s this guy, or that guy, or this chick or that. After a week of prep and rehearsals, she did it live. I didn’t attend.

Finally, I just couldn’t take the harassment any longer. I agreed to help as much as I could. That made them really happy, and I was happy I’d made them happy.

So that night, while Randi is on the air, I start asking Jim questions.

“So where we editing?” – “I dunno yet” “Do we have a script/story line/storyboard?” – “Kinda, in my head” “What’s the premise?” – “The Best of Randi” “No, I get that, but are we just throwing a bunch of these random videos together or is there some theme?” – “We’ll worry about that later”

“Uhhh… Jim.. the thing is DUE for printing in 4 weeks.”

First things first we get hooked up with SportsTalk610 Producer Scotty Mac, who’s father is in charge of WLRN TV. He gets us in the door to use the edit bay, and gives us a guy to show us how to use it. Neither of us had done any video editing.

And every day, for the next 3 weeks and 6 days, 7 days a week it went like this:

```
6:am – Wake
6:30am – Go to WLRN
7a-5p – Edit at WLRN
5p-11 – Prep and Randi’s show
12a Get home, shower, eat, watch TV
2a sleep.
```

On weekends, we’d just work the 7a-5p shift.

And to keep me going, I’d discovered and purchased the equipment to make and consume large quantities of Cuban Coffee at home. There’s a reason they serve it in those tiny cups. Unaware, I was making a pot and putting it into a travel mug, and a thermos to take with me all day. That and my trusted Marlboro Lights. I was the absolute poster boy for bad health. 6’1, 165lbs, chugging Cuban coffee and smoking a pack of smokes each day. But we were actually getting really creative.

Fist we scripted out the idea that we’d do it like a mini documentary.. where we interview people associated with the radio station, and talk about their memories of Randi, when they met her, what she was like to work with, etc. Then, feature them each doing their jobs on air or off… so that in addition to just Randi, people would wanna see it to watch Neil or Rick&Suds in action etc. So we scheduled a day to go into the studio and do segments with everyone (Chuck Meyers, R&S, NEIL, etc). We even went across the property to get Rick Sanchez who turned out to be super cool and a total ham and a goofball just like us, and a failed attempt at talking to Sally Fitz who I’d mentioned in an earlier bed time story was all for it and loved the idea of the video until we mentioned Neil Rogers and she went to pieces in tears over the horrible rumor about a vibrator that Neil kept pushing and how it was absolutely untrue and how she had to move because her neighbors were all whispering and pointing, but I digress.

Then we outlined the order we’d put stuff in. Start with this, use footage from this, and laid out a full timeline by combing through hours and hours of footage, frame by frame, and marking them all down in order.

```
TAPE 3 – Foreigner - :09:07:13 - :22:15:04
TAPE22 – NEIL - :04:44:07 - :14:18:01
TAPE31 – BACKSTABBER :01:01:09 - :07:04:11
```

On and on and on..

Then came the editing. Frame by frame. Second by second. Onto a master tape. Mixing and mastering down the audio. Adding music under segments.

Leaving space to add segments between everything where Randi hosted as the narrator.

It was a grueling, exhausting, effort.

One night, as we were wrapping everything up for the video, and things looked like we were coming to a close of this nightmare or craziness, and we could see the light at the end of the tunnel, it all caught up with me.

Sitting in the control room during the show that Friday night, smoking my 35th Marlboro Light of the day while polishing off the thermos of the Cuban coffee (with a ton of sugar, mind you), I started getting heart palpitations. Which made me panic. Which made me palpitate more. Which sent me into a full cant-breathe, chest-pain, feeling dizzy panic attack. And I asked Jim to drive me to the hospital. He smoked in the car on the way there.

I spent the night in the hospital where they told me to layoff the Cuban coffee for a while, and to eat a “B.R.A.T.” diet because they were pretty sure I had an ulcer too.

2 days later, I was back to editing with Jim.

Through all of it, I’d actually started bonding a little with the guy. I understood him more than I’d had, and we’d worked really hard on this project for Randi. And we’d both learned a ton about each other, from spending time for endless hours in a 4x4 room can like only 2 guys working really hard on a project can.. or, prison.

And Randi seemed pretty happy with the results. So I was back in good graces, and we finished up the project on time, turned it in, and for what we’d started with 4 weeks earlier (which was nothing) to what we’d produced for distribution was a monumental task considering we started with not even a slight understanding of how to produce a video.

And, in the ultimate irony, when it was nearly all finished and ready to print, after more than a month of endless 18 hour days, 4 hour naps, and a trip the the Miami Heart Institute, Jim and Randi decided it would be an absolutely HI-LARI-OUS joke for the audience if when the credits rolled, it read like this:

```
Produced by: Jim

Backstabber, indeed.

# Brooke Daniels

Brooke Daniels joins WIOD.

_by AK - September 4, 2013_

Wednesday Afternoon Bedtime Story: Brooke Daniels stars as Sam Break-your-stones.

I was not Brooke’s producer. I did not work directly with her. But I was there, and had some interaction with her. But mostly, I saw the carnage left behind as she chewed her way through producer after producer…. You’ll have to talk to one of them for more specifics or for confirmation of this stuff… But here’s what I remember..

In January 1997, Brooke Daniels came to what was left of WIOD. Paxson had already purchased, we were already in the new digs in Hollywood. We’re told she’d been taken lured away from North Carolina where she’d been wildly successful. She was jewish, bawdy, and outspoken.

“Great,” I though.. “Randi 2, BrookeDaniels BoogaLoo”

So she starts her shows off at night I think, then gets moved around to different slots and different times and her show is lengthened, and shortened, and finally it’s down to 2 hours noon to two. More of that Harry Valentine and Walter Sabo brain trust ideas of tweaking things every 4 minutes based on what some douchebag filled out on a card.

Brooke was… how should I say this delicately? Ok ok.. I know..it’s a joke… When have I been delicate before on these stories?

Brooke was a ball buster of cosmic proportions. She mowed through producers faster than she could laugh that dolphin-esque cackle of hers. AH-ah-ah-ah-ah-Ahhhhh. “The Piercer”, “Fajita”, and several others all pulled out their hair and curled up in the fetal position at the end of each day. No phone calls? Producer’s fault. Topic didn’t work? Producer’s fault. CD didn’t play? Producer’s fault. Ratings suck? Producer’s fault. Diet isn’t working? Producer’s fault. Can’t find a man? Producer’s fault. It got to the point, and I know this because I was the executive producer responsible for scheduling.. That nobody… I mean NO-BODY wanted that shift. Even the part timers who worked 29 hours per week for 5 bucks an hour didn’t want that full time job. I offered the gig to someone once and their response was “I think I’ll wait until the next time a full time gig comes around…skip me this time”.

Every producer felt like Tom Arnold must have for 5 hours a day.. Forced to work for an overweight nagging, demanding, screaming banshee for just a little bit of money.

See, Brooke, unfortunately (and I say that with the most sincere look on my puss) was no Randi.

Randi took me in. And when things were good, I got some credit where it was due. And when things were bad, she had me share some of the blame if it was warranted. If she wanted me to try something differently, she asked. And if she wanted me to change something, she asked. She may have very well “M-F”-ed me behind my back thinking I wasn’t doing enough, but she NEVER EVER laid into me like I was one of her employees. We were BOTH employed by the same company, working together for the same goal.. But Brooke? Brooke made sure you felt as though you worked for Sam Breakstone in those old cottage cheese commercials… barking orders and yelling at people like they belonged to her.

Here’s another way she wasn’t, despite the billing as, Randi. Sure, she was a Jew-ess, and had a New Yorker accent.. But that was about it. Randi came from humble beginnings, spent time in the Army, lived in some shady situations and was, sorry for saying it Randi.. Kinda low rent back then. Her crass trailerparkish attitude combined with the jew-ess loud mouth neurotic New Yorker is what made her amusing.. And Brooke was no Randi. Brooke was just another loudmouth bossy middle aged jewish lady. She was just like every single resident of Del Boca Vista. Randi was off the wall, bat shit crazy at times, but always fun…and sometimes funny. Brooke was like every lady my mom had over to play mahjong. 2 crack, 3 bam. Oy vey. I’d have nightmares of being in my footy pajamas banished to the den while a bunch of jewey yentas guzzled diet side and ate chips and dip while I listened through the door at the sounds of tiles sliding around, silly mundane whispered gossip about who’s “getting’ a pool next summah” or who’s kid “is going to the community college if the fawl” between fits of yelling out “MAHJONG!” and cackling laughter… but I digress, with a shiver….

One day Brooke has someone fill in for her ‘cuz she had to go to the hospital or something the night before… she’d received massive burns from a home accident. If I remember correctly, I think she’d burned the snot out of her hand on super hot wax during some kind of home waxing accident or someth….o god.. I just vomited a little in my mouth as my brain started thinking ahead of itself while I wrote that… I’ll stop there about what happened.. But needless to say for a week or so after she returned, her had was bandaged in gauze like she had a mummy hand. She had to have help with EVERYTHING. And for a day or 3, everyone was so nice.. But after a few days or so, without any really great treatment back, people starting thinkin’ “ok, WTF am I being nice for?” and the niceness started ceasing. And Brooke whined and biatches every day for help carrying crap to her car, or loading up the computer or hell, probably wiping her ass.

She met a man (who I though was a little light in the loafers if you ask me..) who seemed really really nice.. And kind.. And seemed to like her? I think? She referred to him as Pookie on the air (hurrrrrl) and he allegedly got her pregnant. ? Yeah..it’s still really hard to imagine.

Thankfully, I wasn’t there a ton.. I was with Rick and Suds and we were either on in Mornings way earlier than she was there, or in afternoons hours after her.. So we didn’t see each other regularly.. But I did have to see the carnage daily, talking with the producers. And for their sake, and the audience’s, I was not disappointed when she left. I don’t know where she went.. I’d heard she’d dropped out of radio and was a realtor or something, but never heard of or from her again.

About a decade later, I’m working in DownTown Fort Lauderdale… and I step outside for a smoke.. And out of nowhere… from high above in a skyscraper I hear that “ah-ah-ah-ah-AH-AH-ah-Ah-AH-ah” laugh rain down on me… I look up, trying to see where it was coming from… consider yelling out “BROOKE!” to see who looks over the balcony… and think better of it, and go to the other side of the building to smoke.

# Bryan Cox - I Hate WIOD

Dolphin Bryan Cox doesn't like WIOD.

_by AK - August 6, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Bryan Cox - I Hate WIOD

Tuesday Morning Bedtime Story: “Suck my D_ck”

Ok… think back and remember more than a decade ago.. When the Miami Dolphins were in the hunt every year. When they were the “winingest team in football”. When they were a contender every year. Before 26 quarterbacks and 6 head coaches. Before they went 12 years without a playoff win. When Dan Marino was still the QB and Don Shula was still the head coach.

Remember those days? Before this year’s college freshman were even born yet.

From the day I arrived at WIOD as an intern until the day I was hired as the Rick and Suds Morning Show producer, I was involved with every single Miami Dolphins Football Broadcasts in one way or another.. First I dealt with the tailgate parties put on by WIOD (This was back in the days before the Dolphins were even involved in tailgating…so we did everything. We had Flannigans out there serving ribs and beer, we had a stage with a band playing music on it, we had booths with skills games for prizes, and face painting and all that jazz), then it was the Post Game Show producing with Kim Bokamper in a closed, locked, dark empty stadium for 4 hours after the game ended, then the pre game show. And I was one of 4 producers out at the stadium for 12 hours putting together the Dolphins Draft live broadcast.

After the game on the network, but before the local Post Game Show, was the “Locker Room Show”. And Maddog would head downstairs from the broadcast booth, leaving about 2 minutes before the game even (ever notice he was missing on air for the end of the game?) So Jim would head on down to the locker room, and the producer would listen in the headset and head Jim down there, talking and schmoozing, and on wins he;d be congratulating them and they’d be slapping him on the back. He was a really well liked guy. And Jim would say, “I’m gonna talk to Danny here in a sec, as soon as you can get to me” and the producer would flap his arms at Rick Weaver or Bill Zimphir or whomever the play by play guy was upstairs still in the booth and point to a pieces of paper he’d written “MARINO w/ MADDOG – NOW!” and Zimphir would stop citing stats of the game and say “Our own Jim Maddog Mandich is downstairs in the locker room with Dan Marino… Jim?” And Jim would interview Danny, and say “I’m gonna try and get over and talk to Bryan Cox next.. Back upstairs to you Bill” and he’d cite more stats and take a commercial break and the producer would listen in as Maddog roamed around a very crowded locker room looking for guys to talk to.

So that year was NOT going well for the Fins. They’d lost like the last 3 games in a row, and everyone was all over them about it. The Dolphin’s own flagship hometown radio station was one of the worst offenders.. You had Neil referring to Coach Shula as “The Brainstem” and just trashing the team any chance they could. In mornings, Rick and Suds were talking to the coach every Monday Morning at 7am, and it wasn’t going well. Before they’d taken over mornings, it was Uncle Mike Reineri and Sonny Hirsch talking to the coach…3 old white men talking sports. It was like 3 guys in towels at the Elk’s Club. But now those goofy, non-sports nerds young guys who made people stand in fire ants for money and destroying phones in blenders doing the interview, and every single interview could have ended with the Coach yelling at Rick and Suds to “Get off My Lawn!” The coach really doesn’t have much of a sense of humor. He seemed like a really good guy and all… but his sense of humor was more akin to Steve Allen, and Rick and Suds were like David Letterman and Paul Schaeffer. It was oil and water. It was my job to call the coach in his office at 7am.. And he’d been there since like 5. He always picked up the phone on the first ring, and was always very cordial to me…and I was VERY cordial to him. “Good morning coach. Congrats on the win. We’ll be ready in :30 seconds, please hold” and I’d put him on hold and he’d hear Rick and Suds wishing people “Buttloads” as they talked to a guy who was planning on drinking milk until he vomited… but I digress.

Now, as I’ve said, once I started working for Rick and Suds in Mornings, I wasn’t always involved with the Dolphins Games because on a Sunday night or Monday Night game, it was too late in order to get up at 3am. So I’d do pre game show stuff. And as soon as it ended, I left the stadium and did whatever; sometimes watch the games on tv, or work for the next day’s show, etc. So I didn’t hear it happen. But I helped with the aftermath.

From what I know, the beating the Dolphins were taking from the media, and us especially, was starting to weigh on the players, most specifically Bryan Cox. Every missed tackle, every failed goal line stance he’d be ridiculed on air about. So when the Dolphins finally won a game, Maddog was all smiles heading down to the locker room. And he gets in front of Bryan Cox, and asks him if he’s happy about the win.

In those days, it was a decade before Janet exposed her hooter to the entire world at the Superbowl. We ran the games LIVE on the air, no delay. Its a live event, newsworthy, and we didn’t take any calls. We wanted the TV to match the radio so people could listen to our colorful broadcasters describing the game over the boring TV guys who show video and then reiterate what you just saw.

Now, I didn’t hear it happen.

But when I got to the studio the next morning, the guy running the board overnight (I cant remember if it was Fred Sowder, or Mike Bohan or Ray Trujillo) happened to just ask me matter of factly that if I heard Bryan Cox curse on live air during the locker room show.

We tape everything from the games back then on big, hour long reel-to-reel machines. The sports guys would need to cut up certain plays or interviews for the whole week’s worth of SportTalk610 shows and the Coaches Show etc. So at 4am, I go into the sports office and grab the reels.

And there, plain as day, I hear Maddog do his lead-in, and ask Bryan Cox if he’s happy about the win.

“I’m happy. I hate WIOD. Suck my d_ck, but I’m happy”.

## ![Bryan Cox](https://neilrogers.org/src/assets/bryan-cox.jpg)

_Bryan Cox is Happy - Neil’s Nuggets 1996 - Track 1_

And Maddog ignores it because he know’s he’s live on the air, and continues the interview. I don’t know if Bryan knew we were live or not; not sure he would have cared.

So I carted it up, bleeped. From Maddog asking “Hey Bryan, are you happy? To the end of Bryan saying “…but I’m happy”. When Rick got in, he’d heard about it already and asked me if I had it and I handed him the cart. And he played that thing as part of the recap of the Fins game about every 25 minutes.

When Jorge got there, he just went ahead and carted up the “Suck my d_ck” part too. And Neil had a goddamn FIELD DAY with it. Every caller heard it as they got hung up on. “Hey Neil, your’e a douchebag!” - “Suck my d_ck” Click. Four hours of both versions being played over and over, and Neil ranting about Bryan Cox’s potty mouth and lack of respect for the Maddog and the fans and it made, what could have been the temporary end of the non stop ripping by WIOD of the team, into an even BIGGER reason to just abuse them. Neil suggested that maybe Bryan wasn’t getting any at home and that’s why he’d asked Maddog… I mean the guy’s last name IS Cox…

So after Neil is Phil Hendrie… and of course, Phil does what Phil does best by putting a very unique twist on an already twisted story. He plays the carts, and talk about it, then brings in Jim Mandich.. Well, sorta… In Hendrie style that is.. He interviews himself as Jim Mandich. And then Bryan Cox comes in (again, Phil) and he turns it into a lovers quarrel between Maddog and Bryan captured on tape front the locker room; Bryan propositioned Jim Mandich. And it was FREAKIN HI-LARIOUS. GENIUS. It’s not like Phil’s voices sounded much like either Jim or Bryan.. Hell, he did those same voices for two of his own regular characters. Phil isn’t an impressionist.

A couple of days go by and Guitar Man has a song and Boca has a song and and everyone who did parody songs had their own version about the incident.

Sometime after that, the lawsuit was filed by Bryan for defamation against Phil and Cox and WIOD. His kids were getting ridiculed at school because we were saying he was gay, and hurting his image and all this other stuff. I only know about the lawsuit by what was written in the paper; I wasn’t involved in it at all. I think the lawsuit was eventually thrown out because Bryan is a public figure and after what he’d said on live radio, everything after that was considered parody.

One line, in 2 seconds uttered decades ago, that we all remember.

My parents remember “Ask Not What Your Country Can Do for You”.

Their parents remember “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

And for me, I remember “Suck my d_ck”

# The Cat is Outta The Bag

The cat in the freezer tale.

_by AK - December 15, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > The Cat is Outta The Bag

Sunday Morning Bed Time Story – The Cat is Outta The Bag

This is one of those stories I don’t have every detail on. I was involved in what went down at different points of this story that was 8 months in the making. I was involved initially, then some point mid-way, then the aftermath. So I can only provide info on what I know, what I remember, and what I was told happened.

When Rick and Suds were in afternoons, one of the best parts of the show was undoubtedly the callers. There’s just something about the guys that brought out interesting, unique personalities. Maybe it was that by late afternoon folks were ready to let loose and play around. Once R&S went to morning drive, the callers just weren’t the same; people are too busy and too angry about having to go to work to play fun and games like riding over their cordless phones with a lawnmower or putting their heads in a toilet, or vomiting on the air just for the fun of it.

One of those unique callers with a unique job was a guy whose job it was to drive dead animals, mostly roadkill, but also deceased pets, and “take care of them”. They were freeze dried, then incinerated or something like that. (This is one of those details I don’t remember the nitty gritty of). Anyway, it was really, really interesting, and a little educational, but really odd, and we were all fascinated. When I say we, I mean Rick, Suds, Marvin and I. I was producing Randi’s show, but I was ALWAYS hanging around the R&S Show, and spent a ton of time helping out, sitting in the control room during their show, and just joining in the mayhem.. but I digress.

So the guy comes by the station and leaves a freeze dried cat, curled into a perfect circle like it was sleeping, in a black, plastic trash bag.

WTF do you do with that?

You put it in the freezer of course. DUH. So we did.

And the guys would make jokes on the air about it being downstairs in the nearly-never cleaned out refrigerator downstairs in the cafeteria.

“We got anything to give away Marvin?” Rick would ask.

“Just the cat in the freezer, dude” Marvin would say on air from the control room.

We all just figured everyone knew.

Every now and then, while shuffling things around down there in the freezer I’d take a peek, or feel the curved backbone of the kitty through the plastic bag, and grab my lunch or whatever. I can’t imagine what everyone else assumed when they felt a cat-head and ears through that garbage bag.

So… fast forward months and months later. Rick and Suds are in Morning Drive. I think by then Randi is gone, Marvin is gone, and Phil is on in afternoon drive. And it’s his birthday.

From what I understand… again.. I wasn’t there for this part of the story… someone got Phil an ice cream cake. And they’re having a difficult time getting it to fit in the freezer. As I’ve mentioned, the thing was never cleaned out.. so I’m sure that the process of trying to get a cake box to fit in there was like playing Tetris on a grand scale. Old Tupperware lunches dating back to the Civil War, frozen TV dinners, Microwave lean cuisines, ice cream containers, and some round hard thing in a big black plastic bag. And someone opened the bag. And flipped. The fux. Out.

Like crying and shrieking and hyperventilating. I don’t know if it was Mercy, the super nice, Spanish speaking, middle-aged overweight accounting-marm. Or Stephanie, the gravel voiced, scrappy traffic department manager. All I know is Jennifer Rehm, News Director and Anchor during Phil’s show, lost her mind.

So I show up the next day at 4am and as I pass the lunchroom on my way up the stairs to the studio, I notice the fridge is empty. And spotless. And open. And caution taped.

And by the time the show is over, everyone in the building has come into the control room to ask me about the cat, and tell me about what happened the day prior when someone opened the plastic garbage bag and reacted like there was a dead infant in it. And the lunch room was closed down and disinfected like it was a bloody biohazard scene.

I was apathetic about it, because I’d assumed everyone in the place knew it was in there. It wasn’t a secret; they’d talked about it before, during, and for month after. But the fact that a dead, freeze dried cat was in a plastic bag in the lunchroom freezer was now something that there was going to be an investigation into.

I was called into the Program Director’s office and asked about it.

“Did you put it there?” “No” “But you knew it was there?” “Who didn’t? It’s been there almost a year. Anyone listening to the afternoon show and morning show would have known about it. It wasn’t a secret. It’s freeze-dried. Sterile. Anyone could have opened that bag and seen it. It wasn’t a secret. It’s the cat in the freezer” “Ok. Thanks.”

And that was it from what I know. I don’t know if Rick and Suds got in trouble. We talked about it, but if they ever got in trouble they never told me.

But Jennifer Rehm didn’t speak to me again, ever.

# Hurricane Andrew Part 1

Hurricane Andrew radio stories part 1.

_by AK - July 31, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Hurricane Andrew Part 1

Wednesday Midday Bedtime Story: HURRICANE ANDREW (part 1. Before the Storm)

I’ll have to cover this in 3 separate posts since it covered weeks worth of recapping… There’s a little humor, some sadness, but mostly interesting tidbits of what went down at WIOD prior to, during, and after the biggest storm to hit South Florida in a century.

Let’s remind ourselves first that 21 years ago, before Andrew quickly turned from a Category 1 to a category 5 and slammed into Dade county, there hadn’t been a major hurricane here in like 3 decades. Most people had never experienced this kind of thing before either because they didn’t live here at the time or weren’t even born yet.

So two days out as it’s heading towards us and hits Cat 2 status, projected for a possible 3, the station is a-buzz. And not just because we’re a news station.. For chrissakes we’re on Biscayne Bay. And engineering it tuning up the giant diesel generators, and Norberto is putting those heavy metal panels on all the windows. The Sales department is canceling all commercial orders because we’re about to go into “wall-to-wall” non-stop coverage tomorrow. The Programming office and promotions people are canceling all events and calling air staff that they don’t need to do shows tomorrow. And upstairs, in a hallway, newsman Henry Barrow, Executive producer Marvin Rawman, Sports/Goldberg at Nite producer Manny Munoz, and board-op/part time producer/promotions coordinator Adam Kirschner (me) gather in the hallway to talk about the plan. Do we just evacuate the building and run national news and weather from CBS news or do we ride it out?

The News Department (Anchors, Reporters, Producers) wanted to stay cuz they’re news junkies. The problem was that they needed other people around to get them on the air, relieve them, make outgoing calls to FPL, Bellsouth, Miami and Broward police and fire stations, and Emergency Management offices, cart up audio, work the board, take calls, grab info from the newsroom and wire, etc. They couldn’t force anyone to stay in the building, not with a potential Cat 3 churning in the Atlantic 36 hours away.

Henry’s a senior newsman. He’s done the dance with a storm or 2 in his day. He has an idea what could be about to happen. Manny and Marvin aren’t old enough to remember a major storm of any kind. And me? I’m younger than them, and from New Jersey only living here for 4 years. My only memories of storms is from the “hurricanes” we had up there which by the time they’d gotten to the Jersey Shore (unlike recent Storm Sandy) were no rougher than a tropical afternoon thunderstorm around here with some flooding.

“What do you guys think?” asks Henry of the 3 single, non home owning producers.

“I say we stay.” I say.

“Yeah, we can totally do this.” says Manny.

“We have enough bodies to handle all the shifts and locations” says E.P. Marvin.

And that was that. We were staying.

The plan was that before we closed the doors and basically locked ourselves in, the whole staff worked like an army. 4 of the staff went to petty cash and got about 300 bucks to go raid the Milam’s across the street of anything food and water wise we might need. Another 7 or 8 went to go gas up all the station news cars and station vans. Anyone who was staying went home to grab supplies and pillows and blankets and clothes and anything else we might need. Nobody could be sure exactly what we’d need or how long we might need to stay. When we came back towards the station, we parked our cars on the second floor of a bank building down the street, and someone would shuttle us back to the station.

The next day was the “Day of the Storm” and the continuous coverage started. The only people who came to work were all the news people and news producer (Andrew Kalb) and the producers, the Program Director Boy Gary, and a few other folks who came by early before splitting, and an engineer. We were an army of one, with many leaders at different times. Everyone had a singular focus; helping get the information on the air and out to the public and staying on the air.

One reporter was sent to the National Hurricane Center. One to the Emergency Management Office in Broward, another to Dade. Newsman Dan Stewart (remember.. He’d only arrived here from Boston since like May) took News Director Chuck Meyer’s Ford Bronco to Fort Lauderdale Beach to cover the scene and get reaction from people. 3 Anchors in studio doing shifts. Our Weatherman, Bob Soper, was on vacation in Carolina and He and his wife actually flew BACK just to ride out the storm at WIOD so Bob could be on the air. (THAT MAN, is a great American) and they arrived mid-day.

Around that time the Police Department for North Bay Village showed up. Technically, North Bay Village is an evacuation zone. So 2 officers and the police captain show up to find out what our plan was. “The studios are on the 2nd floor… this building was built long ago and has survived past storms. It;s a concrete bunker. We’re staying”. The police couldn’t force us out, and they didn’t try. In fact, they agreed with us about the building. So much so that they evacuated their own building and made ours their hub for the night parking their cars under our building.

For me and the other producers, our jobs was to keep it moving, feeding the guy or gal on the air information as it came in. “Rip and Read”. We’d rip it off the wire printer, run it in to them, and they’d read it. Or we’d call one of the reporters and get them to come on. Or grab one of the representatives from counties or utilities or whatever and get them on the air. It was crazy. And the storm wasn’t even here yet. It was 5pm.

Dan Stewart calls the hotline to do his report, and I say “Ok Dan.. Hold on..” and he says “WAIT!!”

“What’s up, Dan?”

“Can you call a tow truck?”

“Why? What happened?? Where you at?”

“I’m still at Fort Lauderdale Beach. I wanted great wind and ocean sound in the background of my reports, so I drove onto the beach.. The wind pushed the sound all around and inside Chuck’s Bronco, and now it’s stuck”

I laughed. So did Dan a little.

“Ok. Just do your report… I won’t say anything to Chuck”

And I put Dan on the air and he does his live report, and sure enough you can hear the wind whipping and the waves crashing. When he’s done I call a tow truck and tell them where he’s at, and that he shouldn’t be hard to find… he’s the moron parked on Fort Lauderdale Beach in a WIOD News Car.

Meanwhile, I’ve been working a shift for like 6 crazy, nonstop hours.. It’s way different than doing a talk show. That’s relaxed. You sit in a chair mostly and answer phone and push buttons. And by your 10th time doing it, if you’re good at it, you get a rhythm and can do it without any thought. But this is CRAYYYYYYYzy. It’s nonstop, head-spinning, running, and thinking, and planning, and there’s not a break. Literally. No commercials even. About 40 minutes goes by, and I’m out of breath. So I say I’m takin a break and Manny hops in the chair and I tell him what’s going on and who’s on hold and what’s after that, etc etc. and I go to take a leak, then to look outside and then to grab something to eat. Apparently by the time they’d gotten to the market, the shelves were basically empty. All we had were two loaves of wonder bread, 3 boxes of fig newtons, 4 boxes of those fake pre-packaged cheez-n-cracker things, 3 jars of peanut butter, bottles of water and soda, and lots of candy. So I scarf a whole sleeve of newtons and a peanut butter on wonder bread, force it down with a diet coke, grab a smoke and head back into the control room.

The hotline rings… Manny answers it and says “Yeah, hold on a sec.. You wanna talk on the air?” then.. “Ok, when yer done I’ll put you on hold”

He hands me the phone. Its Dan again.

“Hey dude. Tow truck show up? Get pulled out of the sand?”

“Yeah. But… ”

“But what?”

“He’s calling another tow truck. He’s stuck now too”

All I can do is shake my head and smile.

“Ok..keep us posted” and I hand the phone back to Manny, he goes on the air and does his report, as I put my feet up and half relax as best as you can. At this point, there’s so much going on it’s like watching an action movie. People running in and out, people making calls one after another to different places all trying to get someone on the air with Chuck or Henry or Elaine Ettoire or who’s even in the room behind the microphone. And as it got darker, and as it got later, and as the radar started showing the storm was getting stronger and stronger with each passing hour, we settled into a rhythm.

# Gilbert interviews Ricky Schroder

Gilbert is tasked to interview actor Ricky Schroder

_by AK - July 13, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Gilbert interviews Ricky Schroder

One of my favorite Gilbert bits of all time was one I don’t even have a copy of.. I guess you guys have heard the R&S gilbert best of montage,… on the BIGFOOT Monster Truck, squeezing grapes in his butt, yelling “Syphooon” at Buffalo Bills fans.. but this one was my fav.. largely because knowing Gilbert how I did, I could predict exactly what would happen…

So in order to stay in favor with someone who often got us good guests for the show, they wanted us to interview Ricky Schroeder when he joined the cast of NYPD BLUE… Rick and Suds didn’t wanna really do it… not really their style… so Rick suggested that Gilbert come in and do the interview.. I about peed myself at the idea.

So I went home, did a little research, and wrote a few questions that I knew would be difficult for Gilbert to get thru…

And the first 2 questions I wrote down went like this: “Thanks for being with us today on the Rick and Suds show (knowing it would sound like “Wicken Suds”) First of all, do you prefer Rick or Ricky?” Second question: “So Rick (or Ricky), how do you like working on the new show?” Sure as there’s gravity Gilbert read it as “So Wick or Wicky..”

# Come out, come out, wherever I can see you

WIOD radio story.

_by AK - August 22, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Come out, come out, wherever I can see you

Thursday Night Bedtime Story: Come out, come out, wherever I can see you.

One morning while working Rick and Suds, the hotline rings. It’s Johnny Dolan. He’s filling in on the Coast-fm morning “show” for David K. Schwarts or whatever his name is. He tells me some terrible, corny joke in reference to whatever is going on with Rick and Suds, and I fake laugh, ask him what he’s doing, he tells me he’s one door down on the Coast, (“just on the other side of the wall!” he says, banging on it twice BUMP BUMP like you’d say hello with a car horn) and I make up some story like “I gotta go, Johnny.. Suds set himself on fire again”, say thanks, and hang up.

Six minutes later, hotline rings again.

Now the hotline is a red flashing light on the two phones in both the control room and the studio. So Rick sees it ringing, cocks his head inquisitively but keeps talking to a caller and Suds , I scrunch up my face and shake my head in a “don’t worry about it” non verbal communication, and pick it up again. Johnny Dolan again. A corny joke again. A fake laugh again. A lame excuse again. A disconnection again.

Commercial break. I tell Rick it’s Johnny Dolan filling in at the Coast, and he must be bored playing Ozark Mountain Bluedevils “Jackie Blue” for the 12th time this hour, and he’s listening and totally loving the show, and he’s calling in to tell jokes. Bad ones. The corniest, unfunny, lame “dad jokes” imaginable… and by “dad joke” I mean the kind that even as an adult are so obvious and unfunny and been said 100,000 times that you roll your eyes at the joke teller unsure if you’re sad or embarrassed for them for telling it. Ok, maybe I can explain it easier this way; they’re Al Rogers-esque.

The show comes back on, and the hotline rings again. Rick’s eyebrows furrow… I answer. “Hey, Hey, It’s Johnny…..” another corny joke.

“Listen Johnny, ” I say. “We’re trying to do a show here, and every time the phone rings, the hosts think it’s the PD or someone important, as in not you, telling corny jokes from the Coast studio. So please don’t call the hotline anymore. If you’re bored, call a regular studio line and we’ll put you on the air so we can make fun of you, go for it. We’re working over here. And how the hell did you get the hotline number anyways?”. Midsentence into his response, “Ub, ub erm,..” I hung up.

For those of you who don’t know, Johnny Dolan was and is a South Florida radio legend, in his own mind. He was on all these old music radio stations that were once giants but as they died out, or changed format, Johnny Dolan was always there. When WQAM flipped from music in 197?, “Shotgun Johnny Dolan” was there spinning his pukey “stacks and stack of incredible tracks melting the wax”. When Power or Y or any of those stations big named talent went bye bye leaving a huge hole in their ratings conquering domination, Johnny Dolan was there. And 25 years later, now with jowly cheeks and a crossed eye and a shock of grey curly hair, still with the same pukey voice, the same old school “Disk Jockey” attitude. He’s like a Simpsons character of the 70’s pop radio guy. But I digress…

So after I did the ole “hang-up” to Universe Famous Johnny Dolan, he loses it… and now he’s BANGING on the wall on purpose.. And CRANKING the music in the Coast so loud, Gloria Estephan’s mustache is quivering at home. And the hotline is ringing, and hanging up. And wall pounding. And hotline. And Gloria. And pounding.

Ok… no more mister not-usually-nice guy.

Next commercial break I walk the 20 paces down the hall and swing the huge, wide, 100lb door WIDE open, and say, “Johnny you fucking has-been nobody.. Some of us have actual goddam jobs and we’re trying to do it. You wanna play fake radio you go….”

And he cuts me off… “I’m doing a show right now. Please leave my studio”.

“Ok, Chumley” I say, because he reminds me of Chumley from the Tennessee Tuxedo cartoon… I’ll be back at 10am.” and I leave. A “show”. Har-dee-har. Funniest thing he’s said all morning. The guy gets a list that outlines every song and every commercial he plays in order, timed out on a list, with only a 12 second break where he gets to read a sentence off a prepared 3x5 card written by the program director. Some “show”

I’m PISSED when I get back to the control room.

“Where’d you go? Who keeps calling the hotline? What’s that THUMPING through the walls?” Rick asks in rapid succession.

“That, is Johnny Goddam Dolan who’s filling in today on the Coast… he’s telling lame jokes. I asked him to stop calling, and he resorted to blasting music and pounding the wall. But I’ll take care of it at 10”

“Why? How?” asks Rick.

“Because at 9:59 as the out music is playing, I’m going to thump 30 years of no talent hack out of that guy forever”

Rick and Suds laugh.

At 9:59 as the out music is playing and Jorge takes his seat in the control room, I head back to the Coast studio. In the hallway is a huge 6 foot wide by 3 feet tall double pane glass window. I can clearly see in there. And Johnny sees me. And his eye crosses, and his jowly cheeks turn red. And he’s fumbling around with carts, and cds and papers he never usually touches. And in walks beanpole Wendy Bennett who takes over at 10am, and Johnny’s not leaving. Talking to Wendy who’s looking through the glass at me the way Rick had 2 hours prior, like “wtf is going on?”. I just stare at Johnny. Calmly. Unblinking. Stonefaced.

And 5 whole minutes goes by. And I’m staring…staring.. Staring… into the window into the corn filled soul of that fat walrus… and he won’t look at me. And a crowd is gathering… waiting… watching..

Production Director Mark Hoffmann was there… standing in the doorway leading to his production headquarters…waiting.. Waiting… and Johnny is STILL in there pretending to fumble around with things like he’s just takin care of his “post show wrap up” which actually would only consist of standing up and walking out. It’s the Coast for chrissakes.

And as I’m staring, and the crowd of 2 or three watching… General Manager Bob Green comes lively walking up the hall. I don’t even avert my glare from Johnny. And as Bob passes, he looks at Mark and inquisitively asks, “What goin’ on?”

“Adam’s gonna kick Johnny Dolan’s ass” says Mark.

“Okay” says Bob, who proceeds down the hallway without missing a step.

And Johnny never came out. At 10:30 I went back to post production and Johnny snuck out of the building, and I didn’t see him for 9 years. I never got my retribution… until…

In 2006 I was hired back at WIOD as the morning executive producer for the Brian Freeman morning news magazine show. And on the first day I walk into the control room, to start barking order of how things needed to change and what I was gonna do and what I was going to need done, and express in detail who’s in charge around here……and who should I find as the board op? Formerly Famous Shotgun Johnny Dolan. And that was alllll the revenge I needed.

Hurricane Andrew radio stories part 2.

[Part 1](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/hurricane-andrew-1)

Thursday Midday Bedtime Story: HURRICANE ANDREW (part 2. During the Storm)

Somewhere around 7pm Boy Gary came back to the station for a last look and pep talk to the troops. He was dressed more casually than I’d ever seen him. It was the only time I think I ever saw him without suspenders on. The wind was whipping pretty good by then a tiny corner window that apparently didn’t have a shutter on it in the sales department had broken, and wind was streaming in so violently that the locked glass doors to the sales department at the end of the hallway on the second floor were bowing. I was seriously afraid that at any moment the glass would bend to the point of shattering, sending shards like daggers down the main hallway of the studios. And Gary Bruce, currently no longer tied to the tracks in front of a freight train, jumped into action by going downstairs, grabbing an 8x4 piece of plywood, a hammer and a box of nails and boarded that doorway up in a most unprofessional way. There was no finesse to where those nails went; he pounded them into the walls and frame any which way. And when he ran out of nails, he got screws and a drill. Good for him. Although most of us probably would have wished that when the storm was over, and the entire sales team was back in their area, he’d put the board back and screw them in there (except maybe you, @RickAlpern ).

By 11 pm we were really humming as a team. Chuck Meyer was absolutely outstanding as the main anchor, pivoting between reporters from all the locations around South Florida, the public information officers from police departments all over, meteorologists at the national hurricane center, Bob Soper, and talking with co-lead anchors Henry Barrow and the others. He CAPTAINED that chair and was smooth and as natural as I’d ever heard him.

Around that time I decided to take a break. Well, actually it was my stomach that suggested it… the 2lbs of fig newtons, peanut butter and cheez-n-crackers were starting to brew. Since the only men’s room of the building was on the first floor, the powers that be opened up Mike Disney’s palatial office and private bathroom for us to use, and I did with severity and unguarded abandon. Then I took a nap on the floor of his office on the cushions of his couch.

About 2 and a half hours later I woke up, grabbed coffee, and headed back to the control room. Things were starting to get really nasty out there. And the TV stations started or had already lost power or antennas or both. The wind was beating against the metal shutters of the newsroom that looked out at the bay so loud it actually DID sound like a train. We could no longer open the door leading outside to take a look without having someone hold on to you, and the door.. but you could see the white caps hitting the seawall and washing onto the Channel 7 helipad. You couldn’t look more than a few seconds… the wind and rain was sideways and it hurt and would whistle past you, up the stairs through the building and push on closed doors.

And we just kept rolling on. Once the TV stations were down, and power was out for most, we knew it was bad.. but we didn’t really understand until the calls started coming in. We’d offered to take calls sporadically during the day from folks if they had questions about preparing or evacuations and having them talk to Bob, or the guys from FPL or whatever.. but somewhere around 3:30am, without prompting or asking for them, we started to get calls. From people in South Dade. Fearing for their lives. “I’m under a mattress in my bathtub.. the roof is off”. - “We’re hiding in a closet; it’s the only room in the house that doesn’t have windows or an exterior wall.” - “My kids are crying; the wind is so loud I can barely hear them.”

Thinking back to it now, 20 years later, I get a little lump in my throat. But that night, we were all in “producer mode” and just kept working, while Chuck and Henry and Elaine Ettore and Robert Pankow and Dan Stewart and Jennifer Rehm and Katherine Lister, and Andy Kalb were in “news mode”. So they’d talk to the callers not just as news radio broadcasters, but they talked to them like people. Like their therapists. Like their lives depended on it. And my guess is, that for some of them on the phone, and for many more listening, it kinda did. WIOD was the only lifeline for a lot of people. And at some point around 3:30am, as we could see a cat 4 (now we know it was a cat 5) getting ready to slam into Dade county, we all stopped doing our jobs for WIOD, and started doing our jobs for the people who were out there in the storm, huddled in the darkness, holding on to the one thing that kept them informed on what was happening and when they could expect it to stop. There was a sense of urgency now in what we were all doing at 4:30am then there had been at any point thus far in the 21 hours or so we’d been doing this non-stop. And before we knew it, the storm had passed, and there was daylight on the horizon, both literally and figuratively. And we still had absolutely no idea just how bad it had actually been. There was still no TV to speak of.. No helicopters or photos showing damage. You only knew how bad it had been by what you could see in your own vision. And we only knew by what people were calling in to tell us. Folks in Broward called to tell us that some of them still had power, or that trees were down. And folks in the Gables and South Miami told us they had no power and that the roads were so littered with toppled trees they couldn’t leave the house.

At WIOD, we ventured outside sometime around 11 am or so. Weary, tired, stretching and yawning and wanting fresh air, Manny, Marvin and I ventured outside while Alex Rodriguez worked the board while Chuck and Bob took a nap and Henry and Elaine anchored and talked to callers about what they were seeing. Out the back door of the building, rubbing up against the seawall in a corner of the building was a yacht. A HUGE yacht. Had to be 100 foot at least. So we climbed aboard. Teak wood walls and leather furniture all plastered with seawater and plant materials. Every window broken. Every wine glass and beer mug and china plate smashed and shattered in heaps on the floor. Furniture broken and battered. Soaked papers and ruined pictures in fames in an inch of water. We did a quick run through to make sure noone was aboard and hi tailed it off there.. Who knew if it was going to sink or not, and we certainly didn’t want to be accused of looting, especially since the North Bay Village police were around using our building as their HQ.

We went back inside and continued the day, everyone working in shifts between 2 hour naps.

At some point late in the afternoon, I saw Dan Stewart who showed me the inside of Chuck’s car that had been stuck on the beach. It was plastered inside and out with sand an inch deep. In the cup holders, in the vents of the ac, in every crack of the dashboard console. There was sand in the cassette player of the radio. Sand in the glove compartment. Not long after that I think Dan went up with Channel 7 in the helicopter to do a fly over parts of south dade to see damage. At one point Dan starts freaking out on the air during a report.. “Oh my god.. We’re over… What are we over?” (he asks the pilot) “We’re over Miami Seaquarium and there are… are those? Is that?” (asking the pilot again).. “There are dead dolphins all in the pools and water and beach from this storm. It looks like hundreds of them” The only thing missing was a Hindenberg-esque “Oh the huge manatee!” It turned out not to be true I’m 98% sure. It was pieces of roofs and palm fronds which I guess from 400 feet in the air could look like dead dolphins. Hell, you’ve seen his picture.. Get a look at the thickness of those glasses?

At around 11pm I got a ride to the bank garage, got my 1987 Honda CRX, and went to my parents house in Pembroke Pines and slept there. There wasn’t much damage.. Some trees down in neighborhoods.. That’s about it. I slept for a good 7 hours, then drove back to WIOD. The real storm, Andrew’s Aftermath was about to begin.

# Joey Does Weekends

Joey Reynolds returns to WIOD for weekend shows

_by AK - July 21, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Joey Does Weekends

Sunday Night Bedtime Story BONUS for Mark Srebro, who requested a Joey story: I only have one, and it’s not a long one (i kno, i know… “Thank God” yer thinkin… )

In ‘94 or ‘95 Joey came back to do weekends on WIOD. I think Boy Gary did it just so Neil would have someone to rag on other than Boy Gary. And sadly, I got stuck board opping that show. (Notice I didn’t say “produce”.. I only board-opped… and FYI.. all producers HATED being called “board-op” unless they didn’t want to be associated with the show).

Every hour, of every show, of every week, Joey would play the same goddam bit over and over. And he’d spend 5 minutes setting it up. “He’s one of my favorite bits. It’s hilarious. It was funny to make. You’re gonna like it. I can’t wait to play it. Stand by, I’m gonna play it. It’s hilarious.” Ba-ba-ba-ba. I felt like the “I hate the bird” guy… “JUST PLAY IT ALREADY!”

What’s worse? it wasn’t funny. At all. It might have been 20 years prior, but by 1995 the double entendre humor of 1975 was beyond passe.. it was one step below the corniness of a “dad joke”.

So one saturday, after he left the building, I stole Joey’s “My Dog Sex” cart.

[Part 1](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/hurricane-andrew-1) - [Part 2](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/hurricane-andrew-2)

Friday Midday Bedtime Story: HURRICANE ANDREW (part 3. After the storm, and the Bryan Norcross myth)

In the day that followed, with the return of Neil, Rick and Suds and Hank, things remained steadily focused. Now it was on recovery. We’d set up a hurricane hotline (now every TV station does it the first sign of a cloud coming off the African coast) to take calls from people to get information like where ice, and water was being trucked in or had run out, or that they needed help, where gas stations or food markets were open or closed or to report looting or price gouging. And everyone on staff who wasn’t on air pitched in. Even Bob Soper’s wife Susan came in every day to answer phones. They’d get information and make the appropriate calls to whomever should have that information, like FPL, or the police or whatever. They also kept a growing list they could run in to the folks on the air. So when callers would call in and say “I need baby formula!” the host could ask “Where you at?”, look at the list and a see if they could find somewhere close to them that might be open. The dry erase board that usually only had Camillas House/Center One totals became the board of # people without power list.

By the end of a day or so there would be PILES of note pads in the studio with additions and scratches off as new information about ice and water and open and closed gas stations would come in. And on the air, in addition to having the news team come in frequently to talk about new information, a mix of callers pleading for help or tailing about the destruction we were all about to really learn about.

For most, before the power started to trickle back on for them, they’d only really heard about what was happening by the descriptions we were hearing from callers and our reporters on air. “It’s gone. The whole neighborhood is gone. It looks like a pile of matchsticks” our reporter said about Countrywalk in South Dade. It was still hard to even imagine. And when the tv stations started to come back on for people either because the TV stations got their shit together or because power started to return, it became painful obvious that the scope and scale of Andrew was devastation. We all remember seeing those first few pictures; entire neighborhoods wiped off the map.

After that, as far as work for me was concerned, I was back to doing overnight shifts as Marvin and Jorge and Roger and Manny went back to producing the shows of Rick and Suds, and Neil and Mike Reineri and Hank, albeit their shows were nothing like the pre-storm ones. The fun and games were gone. It’s hard to wanna play “Trouser Trout” or plan a PayPhone challenge when the Army National Guard is building a tent city, and people are swarming trucks of water and fighting over bags of ice like we were in some 3rd world country.

The Promotions Department, of which I was still a part of, started doing battery and water drives. So I spent my days listening to the shows like a listener would, all day, non stop, driving the van and rolling radio store all over Broward and North Dade to collect batteries and water. Every day, 4 different locations, for 3 hours each.

Little by little as weeks went by and things started getting back to normal, and the mood got a little lighter, and the callers started feeling a little better, the shows about where and when ice and water and food and power and all that started to, a very little at a time, be interspersed with a little humor… mostly by the callers. You could feel it that people started to want to have a little something to take their minds off the fact that things were bad and they realized it would be decided before they were back the way they were pre-Andrew. And since the TV stations were just non-stop, around 3 weeks after the storm, we stopped doing non-stop hurricane reporting, and started to s-l-o-w-l-y get back to normalcy a little at a time. That’s about the time when Hank told Boy Gary to go do something to himself that even a Cirque de Solei performer cant do. I wasn’t there, so I only know what I’d heard though the grapevine. Hank was still doing hurricane stuff like the rest of the shows, but because his was primarily an interview show, he did interviews with newsmakers and columnists and such… Hank wanted to totally drop and hurricane stuff and do his show about the Dolphins or something. Gary wanted him to continue talking storm recovery (local and state officials on recovery, yadda yadda), and Hank was like “everyone is tired of this crap”.

“Do it. The audience needs to be reassured and talk about this”

“No. They wanna have sports”

“Do it”

“No”

“I strongly request that you continue to inform your audience about the challenges the community is facing in this difficult time.”

“And I strongly request you go have sexual relations with your own ear”

“No. You’re fired”

Ok, so maybe it didn’t go down exactly like that.. But that’s the gist of it as far as I know. And thus, not long after that, we were blessed with Randi.

About 4 weeks after the storm we loaded up all the vans and the station made a trip to tent city to deliver all the water and batteries and blankets and clothes and things we’d had donated. On the way down the turnpike towards our destination, you could see the damage get worse and worse. The piles of debris get higher and higher as we passed neighborhood after neighborhood of blown out homes. I think I’ve cried maybe 3 times in my adult life. One was the death of my dog. One was during the end of the movie “Mystery Alaska”. And the other was the day we went to tent city in Homestead. People who a month before had been middle-class families of 4 going to nice schools and parks on the weekends and living a normal American life were now in used clothes living in army tents. It was like a scene from Mad Max; rutted hard earth, dirty tattered children running and chasing each other between the tents. Mothers trying to keep it together. Fathers sitting on folding chairs, heads in hand. And in nearly every tent, in nearly every army vehicle, WIOD was playing. …

Now here’s where I talk about the manufacturing of the Bryan Norcross myth.

When people lost their power, back in 1992, 99% of the people around here didn’t have generators. So unless you had a portable unit, you didn’t have tv. And when the TV station Bryan was on went off the air, you couldn’t see him anymore. AT. ALL.

And when the Florida public is faced with a Cat 4 bearing down on them in the dead of night, I’m 100% goddam sure they ain’t tuning in to their favorite pop music station, Y100.

So when roofs were blowing off houses, and people were stumbling out of the shadows the next day and for days afterward, NOBODY WAS WATCHING GODDAM BRYAN NORCROSS, okay? It’s. A. FACT.

Lemme also point out that Bryan’s performance on Y100 was a laughable joke. It’s not like he suddenly became a radio guy. He just kept doing his normal TV broadcast, being simulcast on a radio station. So here’s Bryan, pointing to maps, showing where the red part of the storm hit, talking about the footage he’s watching, showing graphics on the screen.. For PEOPLE LISTENING TO THE GODDAM RADIO!

And despite the storm not happening until the end of August, WIOD was the top AM station, and came in THIRD place behind only WEDR (hippity hoppity rap music) and WLYF (doctors office music).. in the category of 12+ (everyone older than 12 listening to the radio).. And back in those days, Arbitron measured based on people mailing in a survey. Who after Andrew, in Dade County, the LARGER of the two “South Florida” counties, bothered with their surveys???? NO-BODY. So where did Bryan Norcross’s’s’s appearance on Y100 land them? 12th place.

The end.

So what happened? NBC Network National had Bryan on the days leading up to and following once they got back on the air. And then they made a TV movie about how Bryan Norcross single handedly saved the lives of everyone in South Florida, even though nobody saw it. Pure marketing. That’s how.

And how are Chuck Meyers and Bob Soper and Henry Barrow and Elaine Ettore and Katherine Lister and Andrew Kalb and Beth Adams and Robert Pankau and Jennifer Rehm and Halcyon Salazar and Steve Zeigler and Manny Munoz and Marvin Rawman and Alex Rodriguez and Gary Bruce and Neil, Rick, Suds, Hank, Mike and me remembered?

Nowhere on the books or on tv… only in the memories of the people who lived thru it, like us, and truly know better.

# Inadequate Dave

Inadequate Dave from the Rick & Suds Show.

_by AK - August 14, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Inadequate Dave

Rick and Suds Chronic/part-time stunt dude/all-around weirdo: Inadequate Dave.

Rick Riley may remember parts differently; Some of these memories I’m blocking out of my consciousness.

Somewhere around 1997, Rick got a letter from a fan. It was a long, rambling, hand written note on like 5 pages of yellow legal pad sheets. It was from a guy named Dave. To summarize the entire thing, it was something like, “Hi, my name is Dave. I’m down on my luck. I lost my job. Your show keeps me from shriveling up and crying” or something to that effect.

Dave had worked for a local, non-network TV station in their department that schedules commercials to run, and due to cutbacks and downsizing and a need to get rid of Dave, they did. He’d only moved here a few years earlier. He’d allegedly graduated from Boston College or something.

Dave was so moved to hear his letter read on air that he called.

And none of our lives would ever be the same.

He sounded like such a nice guy… very well spoken and articulate and just plain down on his luck…and he LOVED the show with a passion. Rick even quizzed him and he knew every show bit (Newssss from aroundddd the Planet-anet, Key West Police Blotter, Pay Phone Challenge, Top Ten Tabloid Trash Headlines, on and on) he knew every bit played, and he even knew the regular callers (He expressed a fondness to meet a guy appropriately named “Mr Donkey-ass”). He just was soooo down on his luck..and said very plainly that he wanted to work for the show any way he could.

And Rick said okay.

“Maybe you could do a Pay Phone Challenge? We could pay you $125 bucks, but you’d have to agree to do, and succeed at whatever the challenge was… Adam won’t mind at all… he hates trying to get the pay phone to be answered”

“Okay by me” I said from the control room. See, as cellphones became more and more common, pay phones were harder and harder to find. Plus, in order to combat drug sales, many of them couldn’t receive incoming calls. Throw in that it’s 7 goddam AM… and NOBODY has time to answer a pay phone, let alone take off for a few hours to try and win $125 bucks… so it started to become a real hassle to get someone to answer the phone. A few times I would just grab someone walking down the street and beg them to answer the phone for a chance to win money. Once I even told a friend in advance where I’d be and asked him to show up.. Turns out he did the bit doing traffic reports on the old Space Coaster Swing over I-95, and actually made it onto the Best of Rick and Suds Video. At one point, we even started giving out the pay phone location in advance in hopes someone would drive there to pick it up. But I digress.

So the idea that at least for one week I wouldn’t have to go thru that riggormarole, was good for me. Off the air we got his number, and when I went out for Pay Phone Challenge, I called him, and he showed up. In his 1986 blue P.O.S. Stock Camaro, all run down and faded blue and filled with clothes and garbage. Poor Dave.

The deal was we were putting him in an industrial dryer at a laundromat with a paper cup and 49 golfballs, each with a number on it. We spun him 6 times, and he got the dollar amount for whatever he caught in the paper cup. The golfballs made such a huge racket that one the air it was ear-candy, and with the helpless whimpering of super sad Dave sooo eager to please, it made for a great bit. Afterward I got his info, and told him we’d mail him a check.

A few days later, Dave called again. He wanted another chance. So Rick and Suds goofed around with him on the air a little, and said okay. The next time we did a pay phone challenge and as the bit ended, successfully completed by Dave, he asked Rick if he could be called Super Dave, since I was called Dangerman Adam. Rick told him so far, he’d been okay, and the name Super Dave was already taken, so he was given the moniker “Adequate Dave”.. Off the air, behind the scenes, the guy was starting to drive me bonkers.. On and on and on .. So after the show, I hand him his check from the previous bit, and he starts hemming and hawing…he couldn’t cash it because he didn’t have a bank account, and the company didn’t use a local bank. So I had to go to my bank with him.. Standing behind me in line like some 5’8 120lb child… just talking non-stop in my ear…Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-BA-ba-ba-ba.. Hopping around like an anorexic Peter Pan with ants in his pants wearing a button down dress shirt and an old skinny tie, all pit stained from doing the stunt.. And I start looking more closely at him in the bank lighting… and I notice…

“Are you wearing make-up dude?”

“noo.. Makeup? Noo.. I;m not wearing make-up. Hey when am I gonna meet Mr. Donkey-Ass? Maybe we can do a stunt togeth…”

“Dude are your eyebrows tweezed??”

“Eyebrows, no.. Hey can Gilbert and I do a pay phone challenge together”

The next day I tell Rick and Suds, on the air, about the eyebrows and make up, and on cue, Dave calls in to defend himself. Like he’s got anything else to do? No WONDER he’s unemployed. Who wants this child-like make-up wearing muppet on their staff? Nice guy, but wow.

“Didn’t I do a good job?” says Dave. “Aren’t I ‘Super Dave?’”

“Adequate Dave” says Rick.

“Inadequate Dave the eyebrow Tweezing, Makeup wearing, unemployed weirdo living in his Camaro” I pipe up from in the control room. And “inadequate Dave was born. Only I ever called him that, but after that I never referred to him any other way. EVER.

And Rick started to invite him to tag along more frequently after that.. Mostly because it was probably decent radio to hear the 90’s Gen X version of Laurel and Hardy being forced to spend time in the station van driving around getting ready to shave old ladies beards and asking people to borrow their socks. And every. Single. Time it was nails, screws, knives, and a cheese grater on a chalkboard on my nerves. The guy just got weirder and weirder.

One day, while driving around to help some guy empty out the storage unit he both stored his things in and lived out of, Dave mentioned that he’d been thrown out of his house at a young age with only some clothes and a few books in a pillow case or something. I mean this guy was a mess, and it started making sense. But not that much.

And I never let up. I would rip into this guy like a monkey into a cupcake, and he was always smiley and happy. At some point for me, it stopped being a bit.. I really started to dislike the guy. Just always calling, and always sucking around..

That’s about the time Rick proposed we set up a boxing match and I think just hearing the suggestion gave me excitement I cannot describe. OH MY GOD I’m GOING TO PUMMEL THIS WEIRDO SO HE’LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PLUCK OFF HIS EYEBROWS and WEAR MAKEUP!

About a week or two prior my mom called me and in her very jewish motherly way, asked me not to do it. That made me want to kick his ass even more.. Then, as I started to think about it, it occurred to me it was a no win situation for me. If I kicked his ass, I’d look like a bully beating up a make-up wearing, eyebrow tweezing, unemployed, orphaned 120lb man-boy, and if I lose (very highly unlikely), that’d be even worse. So I dealt with it the only way possible… I abused him mercilessly every opportunity I could. Nothing was off limits. Ever.

And I did that until the day I left the show, even including him in my on air “Last Will and Testicle” where I left Suds my password to AsianWhores.com, Rick Riley the AOL2.5 disc he’d received in the mail and given to me for my birthday, and a dress to go with his makeup and tweezed eyebrows.

This is how I remember Inadequate Dave looking… (photo missing)

# The Magic Cookies

WIOD radio story

Thursday Afternoon Bedtime Story: The Magic Cookies

Apologies in advance because this is a long one and needs to be told this way. If I had an editor I’d tell him I’d sooner not publish it than change it. So read it or don’t read it….

This one really isn’t about Neil; in fact it has nothing to do with him, but it does refer to and have direct relationship to a guest who often appeared on Rick and Suds and I think probably Steve Kane and Norm Kent and probably a few others too… and frankly, who the hell else would I tell this story to now besides you fine folks?

In the U.S., at least at the time this happened, there were four (that’s right..count them on less than one hand) people who received medical marijuana from the U.S. Government. Not “you have to get a doctor to write you a script and go fill it out at any number of weed stands in California or Colorado or other states… Actually provided by the U.S. Of Uncle Sam. And one of them is a colorful little lady with severe glaucoma named Elvy Musika.

And she was on the Rick and Suds show in the mid-90’s a few times,, maybe 3 or 4, to talk about how to her, it is indeed medicine, and how it shouldn’t be classified as this or that, and how for her medical condition it’s a necessity.. And for aids patients to help them with appetite after the drugs, and all these other things.. Pretty much what we mostly take for granted 20 years later and many states agree with, even though the Federal Law hasn’t changed.. But Elvy, let me remind you.. Gets her stash FROM THE FEDS.

And that was what I found most interesting about her and her story. Don’t get me wrong.. I agree with much of her points, but she’s a kook hands down. The ‘60’s garb, the patchouli oil, the hemp handbag,… But hearing her talk and SHOW us how the Fed doles out her “medicine” is really kinda fascinating.. They send them to her (again..this was in 1995) in a standard brown pill bottle, all rolled into the most perfectly rolled cigarettes.. This aint no “Snoop Dogg, coat the thing in spit and dry it with a lighter tapered turd torpedo”… this is cut at the ends, perfectly round Marl-juana Lights. And she shows them to us. And despite how perfect they look, I can’t help but feel a little bad for her because the weed inside it cack; brown shake from the worst stuff cop-and-stop nicklebag Grand Avenue dealer. And she’s watched like a hawk by the Feds to assure this and prevent that, etc. Totally not worth it.. Shed be way better off talking to Marvin probably, but she’s got her principles and such.

One time while she’s in the control room waiting to go on the air, I ask her, “So you have the right to smoke weed anywhere you want? You got clearance from the government! You’re so lucky!”

“No,” she says.. I have the right to smoke in my house or car… but it doesn’t mean I can just light up a joint on a city bus or on an airplane”

“Woah.. That sucks. So what do you do?”

She starts fumbling around in that giant hippy hemp bag or hers and says “C’mere”. I wheel my console chair around to her side, and she shows me what she’s holding in the hempurse of hers.. A standard issue sandwich bag. And inside it are 2 cookies.

“I unroll the joints I get and bake it into cookies and take them with me”

“NO WAY! Why not just make brownies?” I titter with incredulity.

“I just don’t like brownies. And the cookies are easier to eat and I can specify the exact amount in each cookie” she says from behind those huge dark sunglasses, smiling that goofy smile of hers. “Here. Take it” she says crumpling up the baggie into her had and shoving it into mine.

“Ohhh I cant! I cant! It’s yours. You need it”

“I insist” she says looking right at me, at least I think she was.

And with that, I took the plastic bag, stuffed it into my briefcase, and continued with my day. At around 7pm I got home and broke the news to my then girlfriend about the gift bestowed on me. “BEHOLD” I said, holding out the bag like I was Mufasa showing off my Lion King son. I explain what they are, and take one out, and bite into it.

I chew twice. Swallow. And nearly choke. It’s unsweetened, lumpy tasteless cookie dough baked with weed, stems, seeds moderately chopped inside.

Their taste can best be described as “vacuum cleaner bag dirt cookies”. I crumple the remaining cookie and the 2nd cookie into the bag, and chuck it in the garbage can.

We have a few friends coming over that night and I’m cooking a shrimp fra-diavolo for us all before we all go out to some club or the movies or whatever. And dinner goes great, the food is great, and the company is great. I make an incredible gravy and have really fresh shrimp to work with and it’s a really good dinner I prepare for 6 people.

We come home at around 2am and the place is a disaster.. There’s broken stuff everywhere, the dog is missing, there’s old pasta and shrimp tails everywhere… We start frantically, cautiously walking through the house looking for missing things, broken windows, open doors…

Raise your hand if you know what a “Schipperke” is…. Anyone? Bueller?

You in the back…yes. It’s a dog. It’s a little belgian boat dog they used for killing rats, and they all look exactly alike without any variation; black furballs that are intensely mean to anyone they don’t know and even some they do. They’re notorious ankle biters and barkers and insanely territorial. And insane. Snarling and gnashing of teeth is normal unless it’s just the people who live there sitting on the couch. Anyone or anything new in the house is greeted by a cacophony of yaps and barks and snarls and snorts and wide-eyed staring and teeth. They’re super smart, too… Ours once climbed up onto the dining room table executing what must have been olympic gymnast-like moves, opened the pizza box, and ate all of the toppings and cheese leaving only the red-stained crust with footprints in it while we made our drinks and a salad… but I digress…

One we figure out we haven’t been robbed, we just assume the dog, once again, has knocked over the kitchen can and had made the biggest mess ever. But where is she?

She comes out of a back room walking slowly, gingerly. Her eyes are crossed and unfocused. She can hardly walk or stand, as if she’s dizzy. . She’s panting like she’s run a marathon. She won’t eat anything….which has never ever happened. We try and calm her, check her vitals, see if she’ll drink anything.

“Omg was she poisoned?” the girlfriend asks.

“I don’t think so… there wasn’t anything in the garbage can that…. Oh… wait”

We look at the dog, who vomits up about 4 lbs of pasta, shrimp, salad, and remnants of a plastic baggie before falling on her side.

“She’s stoned” I say.

Sure enough, I go through what’s left of the trash around the house, and the cookies are gone. And with an hour or so, the dog is back to her normal self.

The next day the girlfriend and I got out for lunch, and when we get home, the trash from the kitchen is everywhere again. There was nothing in there, but we’re pretty goddam sure she was looking for more of Elvy’s cookies.

# Reineri on his own

Story about radio's Mike Reineri.

_by AK - July 28, 2013_

Monday Afternoon Bedtime Story: Reineri on his own.

I’ve never told this story, and I’m not proud of it at all. Many board-ops lost their jobs over things like this, but thankfully, and deviously i covered my tracks enough, or so I think, so that I didn’t get fired on the spot.

Mike Reineri’s show was different than all the rest in many ways, but most noticeable within the building because his was the only show where the host didn’t do his part in the talk studio; he did it from the control room.

Since “Uncle Mikey” had to throw it to the traffic report every 3 minutes, and a weather report every 4 minutes and news headlines or news update every 15, and commercials every 7, it was just easier to have uncle Mikey do all that stuff than have a board op have to figure out when he had to do the “Pattern Trance” and all that Ooga Booga.

His producer, Roger, sat in the talk studio writing out all the cards and slips of paper Mike had to read, loaded up stacks of commercial carts for Mike to play, ready the telepoll (record a voice message on an answering machine then edit all the responses together with music bed under them) etc etc.

Roger was set to go on vacation for a week, and for some reason, he and whomever made the decision decided to give me my first big shot at producing a live weekday show. Sure, I’d worked the weekend shows like The Garden Guy and Meg Green… but this was a PRIME TIME SHOW that had to be produced, not just board-op. Roger looked like a thinner version of Rip Taylor, white hair and mustache, and always wore a panama hat and jogging shorts and boat shoes. He was a pilot, and he greeted everyone with “Mornin’ Handsome!” and labeled everything he owned with “No Touch!” which actually had the opposite affect in most cases.

First day went good. I arrived at 4am and got everything all set up. I was really nervous, and tried my best to make sure the telepoll and other stuff was suitable for the morning show of Uncle Mikey’s tempo. A 23 yr old flannel wearing, multiple pierced ear, chain smoker isn’t exactly their primary demo if ya know what I mean. But I got through it. And Mikey was complimentary. And Neil ragged on me calling me “Roger Junior” and stuff.

That night, I went to hang with my room mate and party. I call him my room mate because I lived with him in college, but at the time I lived at his house , sleeping on a blowup mattress on the floor, living out of boxes. at $4.25 an hour for 29 hours a week, you can’t exactly live on your own. So this was a BIG shot for me to establish myself as the next full-timer. But I digress…

I was still so nervous and excited that I couldn’t sleep, and when I finally fell asleep at like 2 am… yup. you guessed it. I slept through not one, but TWO alarm clocks. When I woke up at 7:15, a full hour and fifteen minutes AFTER the show started, I frickin PANICKED like never before. Not just because I was REALLY late. Not just because this was my big chance. But because the guy who worked the overnight shift the night before, the guy who normally would have covered my shift until I got there… was blind. That’s right. Blind. with his seeing-eye-dog with him. Overnight board-ops play spots between syndicated Larry King, and with the board and the commercials all labeled in braille, he was a damn fine board operator. God bless you, Mike Bohan… We miss you and your dog Iris (yeah.. he named the dog after a part of the eye. He was a great guy). But as a live show producer he was, for lack of a better word, he was sincerely handicapped.

There weren’t even cellphones then, just beepers. And mine had gone off like 27 times already. I hopped in my car and drove a block to a gas station and called the hotline and Mike answered. I’d told him I was on my way, but had gotten a flat on the highway and was stuck with no spare and had to wait for a tow truck to fill my tire with air and thats why I was so late.. and please let everyone know i’d be there soon.

I ran to the back of the car, wiped my hands on the rims of my car, and wiped grease and dust on my hands, arms, pants, face. I pulled out my spare, deflated it as best I could, and threw it and the jack in my back seat and drove to the station. I arrived around 7:45, and appropriately, I looked like hell.

Nobody said a whole lot about it to me.. a bunch of “man that sucks” but that was about it. It never got mentioned again, and the rest of the show went pretty much as planned, me thanking everyone who’d helped out with helping Mike get his show on the air, like the news folks and Mike Bohan, and Uncle Mikey who had to leave his comfort zone and do the show differently than he probably had to in more than a decade.

And from that point on, if I had to work a morning shift, I’d set 3 alarms and left the number of wherever I was sleeping with whomever was working the night shift with explicit instructions to call me over and over if they didn’t hear from me by 4:45am.

Here’s what I probably looked like that morning. (photo missing)

# Neil's Arrest

Neil Rogers was arrested.

Friday Midday Bedtime Story: Giving Neil a Helping Hand

I’d be a real “jerk” if I claimed to know everything about this story; I can only give you my recollections, and I certainly don’t know everything and therefore, is not my finest story. So take it for what it’s worth…

As I’ve mentioned previously, very early on in my time there, one of my jobs was to run the board overnights from 11pm until 5am when the news started with Henry Barrow. The main purpose and requirement of this position in to stay awake. Every 20 minutes you press a button to start the cart sequence of 5 or so commercials, promos and a rejoin as soon as Larry King says “..on the Mutual Radio Network”, slide down the “pot” (which is a slider knob) to the muted position, slide it back up when the commercial break is done, and load up your next block of carts into the rack. It’s REALLLLLLLLY boring, and there are only 2 reasons the board-ops would stay awake; an opportunity to find a Larry King gem to cart up for Neil, and attempting to seamlessly play drops of Larry at inappropriate times. “Charlston, hello!” - “Larry, today is my birthday” - “Uh-huh”

At 4am the news peeps start coming in to prepare the news for the 5am hour and for the rest of the newscasts throughout the day. They’re reading the papers, scouring the wires, carting up clips our reporters are covering, carting up weather forecasts, etc. It’s a welcome break to the monotony of the overnight, and it means it’s time to turn up the lights in the control room from the darkness you’ve had it in while you keep one eye on the lights of the board and one ear on the audio monitor while the other ear and eye watch “Police Academy 38” on the cable tv.

So one morning at around 4:30am, Henry Barrow walks in and says “Didja hear?”

“Hear what?”

“Neil got arrested”

“He DID? For WHAT?”

“Masturbating in public”

I laugh. “WHUT??? No WAY. When? Where?”

“Last night. At some triple x theater in Miami Beach”

“O please. You’re kidding. Neil? In a porno theater?”

“And it’s our lead story this morning”

“WHUUUUUUUUT??????”

“I talked to Boy Gary and Chuck. It’s huge news, and we can’t avoid it or we look like we’re playing favorites because he’s on our station. It’s a credibility issue.”

Damn that Henry Barrow. He’s a REAL goddam newsman. And he’s “absolutely correct, sir”

So now it’s a 3 ring circus in the building. Once Henry blurts that out at the 5am newscast, the phone start ringing from people either calling to laugh at Neil because they hate him because he once ripped them for being a douchebag, or people looking for more information about the story. And I know as much as they do from hearing Henry tell the story. The hotline rings and it’s Boy Gary. “Neil won’t be in today”. Duh.. Okay.

“I assumed” I said.

“Jorge knows he’s playing tapes”

So I finish the shift, and drive home and listen the whole way to Uncle Mike Reineri the way I always do..he’s so folksy and grandpa-ish that it’s nice to hear him ooga-booga all the way home. And today he’s no different, same show, same pace… is there a chuckle in his voice today? I might be imaging it, but it feels like he’s got that same “C’mon… No way.. Not Neil…” attitude everyone else seems to be expressing. I get home, run in (the house is dark; I’m still living with mom and dad at the time… you can’t get your own place at $4.25 and hour for 29 hours max per week) and crawl into bed with the radio on.. Hearing Henry and Mike and Sonny Hirsch and Roger occasionally mentioning that Neil was out today… but tomorrow’s show was going to be a barn burner for sure, and people had better get their tape recorders “handy” if I can say that..…and I listen until I fall asleep. When I wake up, the radio is on, and Rick and Suds are doing their normal show, and taking calls from people, some of whom are talking about Neil, or doing their PeeWee Herman impressions, and making light of the story.

The next day, I’m not scheduled to work until 11pm, but I’m too wound up about the day, and Neil, and this whole story. So I go to the office and get there at like 9:30am.. I HAVE GOT TO BE HERE FOR THIS. There aint NO WAY I’m missing it. WIOD those days was like a high school.. You had the popular kids (Neil, Rick and Suds), the moderately popular kids (Jorge, Marvin) the hanger-onners (board ops and promotions coordinators), the bullies (Hank) the nerds/geeks (Sales Department) the Principal and Assistant Principals (Managers, Program Directors) etc. So when the Home”cumming” King gets busted for whacking it in a porno theater, everyone wants to look at him, talk to him, even if it means going to his shop class while you skip math class. But I digress…

So Neil “comes” in, with that big, fake, forced grin on his face. Not fake like he’s being fake nice, but fake like he’s letting you know he’s 100% forcing a smile sarcastically so you know how he feels and lets you in on it. And he addresses me that same way he often did, sing singing “How’s it GOIN’ Aaaaaahhh-dam?”

“Me? How’s it GOIN Neeeeeiiiiiil? You tell me” I reply. It’s just him and me in the talk studio; Reineri does his show in the control room, and Roger has already gathered up his stuff to get out of the studio.

“It’s a bunch of crap” he says. “Can’t talk a lot about it, but it’s not true, and it’ll get thrown out.”

“Yeah? Sounds like a bunch of BS.” I say, sucking around “hard”.

I go into the control room and sit across from Jorge, who’s doing his normal show stuff. He looks up from the telephone screen in his lap, raises one eyebrow, and says “This should be interesting”

The show starts and Neil launches right into the “Freedom’s Dead” song. He talks very matter-of-factly about what the news reported, and declines to be able to give much more details other than to say he’s not guilty of what they accused him of, and spends the rest of the day taking calls from listeners either supporting him or making feeble attempts to make jokes at his expense (fools… don’t they know who they’re talking to? It’s NEIL for crying out loud). Lots of “pigs” calls, and “fascists” calls, people giving spy reports about where cops are, and Neil doing what Neil did best. “Milking” the most out of the story of the day… it made absolutely no matter that the story of the day was him

# Phil Might Be Crazy

Phil Hendrie joins WIOD.

_by AK - August 5, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Phil Might Be Crazy

Monday Morning bedtime Story: “Hey guys, I think Phil might be crazy”

Some of the details might need verification from either Phil or his producer Andy, but here’s what I remember about when Phil came to WIOD…

The hallways were a-buzz about a new guy coming to town, as was typical of those days. Before they even hit the air, the existing part time air staff, one or two of the insecure full-time air staff, and most of the producers, myself included, were always looking for dirt on folks. Some because they were afraid they’d be replaced, others to be the little birds who whispered into Neil’s ear or ready to cart up some choice carts from their first show.

“OKAY!”.

So the buzz was this new guy was coming in, and all we knew, and all we whispered about was one thing. “He does voices.”

Whut? Oh brother. Some corny morning show guy who does impressions of celebrities thinks he’s gonna make it at WIOD doing his schtick of impressions of Johnny Carson and Ronald Reagan? This outta be B-R-U-T-A-L.

So they move Rick and Suds to Mornings, put Randi in afternoon drive after Neil, and this new guy starts doing the night show after SportsTalk610. And I’d catch a few minutes here and there, and it sounded like he was just doing a talk show, talking to the cretins that would have been bugging Randi if she was still on that time slot. I didn’t hear any Johnny Carson or George Bush “Not prudent” garbage… so.. I didn’t pay a ton of attention… Normally, I wouldn’t have stayed 2 hours past Randi’s show.. But once or twice I did, probably because Randi wanted this or that and I ended up working late. And I’m in a production room, and click on the “WIOD ON AIR” switch to listen for a minute or 2. And Phil’s doing some terrible interview with some lady who might just be the biggest bitch I ever heard. So I pack up my stuff, and head into the control room.

Phil is sitting in the main chair of the studio. He’s taken the phone in that room, and called the hotline in the control room. The producer has put the hotline on the air. And Phil is talking into the mic, then the phone, and then the mic, and then the phone.. Having a conversation with himself. And whenever he talks into the phone, just before he stops talking into it, he presses a cart button, his recorded voice says “Yeah, but wait a sec…wait a second” as he cuts himself off talking live into the phone. Then he talks into the mic again as Phil, asking a question of a bitchy lady. Then he picks up the phone, and with his eyes closed, answers the question as Margaret from Bal Harbor.

As he opens his eyes and goes to talk back on the mic as himself, I catch a faint grin on Phil’s face and the movement of his shoulders as he shudders an inner, silent chuckle and asks Margaret, err, himself to hold on for the break. Margaret agrees, but emphasizes once again that she’s a very busy lady and can’t wait too long.

The biggest goddam grin slowly creeps across my face. Phil caught a glimpse of me in there with that lightbulb beaming over my head in the control room… and I think he winked at me… that big, broad Randal P. McMurphy from “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” grin with a wink…like I was now in on the joke.

But I’m not 100% sure… because it may have very well been Margaret who winked.

Apparently, from what I’d heard and read about Phil since is that he used to be your garden variety DEE-Jay.. Spinning records. Then started doing a talk show. Somewhere around Gulf War One, when he had no callers, he called himself as a joke just to illustrate that nobody was on the phone. And he came on as an iraqi who was very upset because Saddam Hussain was getting a bad rap about this whole invading Kuwait and gassing his own people thing. And callers started calling in to argue in absolute disbelief, but believing every word the caller, err, Phil was saying. And thus, Phil Hendrie’s insanely unique brand of talk show was born…

So fast forward to a few weeks after I got in on the joke…. Neil finds a cart in the studio. And plays it. And it’s 10 cuts of Phil cutting off gusts.

“Yeah, but wait a sec…wait a second”…

“Yeah but” …

“Okay…Okay”…

And it becomes instant gold. And now people are getting in on the joke…and realizing just how unique and talented Phil is. Because after Neil gets his hand on that cart, Phil stops with the talking-over-himself, and gets SO good at switching the voices, that it seems as if they REALLY are talking over each other.

A couple weeks later they move Phil to Afternoons and move Randi back to nights…I’m guessing all along that they’d planned to have Phil in Afternoon Drive, but wanted to see how the audience reacted, how Neil reacted, and if Randi would crash and burn in afternoons…. and now I get so see the nitty-gritty of what went into putting Phil’s show together and how it worked…

Phil would come in with a yellow legal pad. And he and his producer/former news producer Andy Kalb would go out to the picnic bench while Phil smoked Marlboro Reds and they’d talk about the big 5 or so stories of the day. Then they’d come up with fake guests or fake callers that could either be interviewed about the issue or might be upset and want to talk about the issue. By the end of the meeting Phil would have 2 pages filled with ideas. Some days, it would just be something not really related to a big story, it would be just a funny weird idea Phil had… Like the guy who wants to do the naked children’s Easter Egg hunt in his yard. Jesus Phil… you gotta be a lot twisted to think up something as obscene and humorous and sick as that.

Some days, it wasn’t a caller at all. It would be a cooking segment with Jim Mandich and Kim Bokamper (who, in my mind, during the bit, sounded and acted an awful lot like Tennessee Tuxedo and Chumley). Genius. GOLD. Insane.

Other days it was drinking or karaoke with GM Bob Greene.

And on some days, it was neither.. No voices at all… Like play-by-play of YOUUUUR Florida Marlins versus the Helen Keller School for the blind.

And those days… are the days I’m talking about…

I walk into the control room unaware of what Phil had been doing so far on his show, expecting to see Phil vacillating between talking on a telephone and a microphone. But that’s not at all what I saw.

The lights in the studio are down low. Phil is behind the mic. And he’s SCREAMING into it. Spit is flying from his mouth. He’s beet red in the face, staring wildly into the control room where I’m standing.

“Mike Tyson throws a LEFT! And a RIGHT! And ANOTHER RIGHT. UPPERCUT!!! OHHHH MY ANGELA LANSBURY IS DOWN!!!! AND THE COUNT BEGINS… ONE.. TWO!!!”

And I look at Phil. And realize, he’s not staring at me in the control room. He’s staring right at Angela Lansbury struggling to get off the canvas, grabbing the ropes to climb up, as Iron Mike paces in the corner like a caged animal waiting to spring.

And I turn to Andy, and calmly, matter-of-factly inform him that I think Phil might be crazy.

# Randi's Best of Video

Behind the scenes for the production of the Randi Rhodes Best of Video.

_by AK - July 19, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Randi's Best of Video

Ok…here’s a FRIDAY EDITION Bedtime Story. it’s a little long, but stick with it if you can.. it wraps around to Neil stuff ..

Back when I was workin’ with Randi Rhodes, she had it in her head that she had to out-do all the other personalities on the air, and instead of doing a Best of CD, she was going to do a Best of Video. She’d filmed a few things here and there before I’d even started working for her, and then when we had Foreigner, and then Kip Winger perform in studio, she’d filmed those, then her in some club or bowling alley singing “Back Stabber” and all this nonsense. So like 6 weeks before they’re do to press (i was barely in favor of just doing a CD that would have taken about 6-8 hours worth of work to complete, but that wasn’t good enough for Randi) I got roped into spending my day from 9a-3p with “This Is Jim” at WLRN-TV combing through hours and hours of tape. Then I’d drive to the studio and work from 4p-midnight on the show, then start over again the next day. This went on for 5 weeks.

While all this was going on, Jim and Randi figured the best way to have all these oddball clips linked together was by having, on video, everyone in the building talk about how much they all loved and respected and worshipped at Randi’s feet. Yeah I know, I know.. I was just along for the ride.. I busted my ass like this, chugging cuban coffee all day, and ended up in the hospital with chest pains one night, but as usual, I digress..

Ok, so as part of this deal, Jim would head over to Channel 7 next door and try and get Rick Sanchez to record a little bit for the video, maybe talking about Randi, and also Neil, or others on the air. Rick is Rick, and hes always up for camera time.. and despite the non-stop attacks, he was actually a pretty nice, all-be-it super kooky guy. Goofy. Total ham. and totally willing to participate.

Next time, he approaches Sally Fitz. (This part is all based on what I was told.. I was NOT there at the time.. so.. it is what it is…) And they start talking about what he’s working on, and Randi this, and Randi that, and apparently she seems pretty ok about it…

Until…

He mentions Neil.

And she loses it. Like hysterical. In tears, even. “That man.. ohhhh.. He’s so mean to me… (sobbing, angry, losing it).. “telling those awful stories about me that AREN’T TRUE! I had to MOVE! I can’t look my neighbors in the face because they all think I was in the hospital with a DILDO in me!”

And that’s when Jim wrapped it up, thanked her, and carried his unopened camera bag back next door to WIOD and repeated what’d just happened.

Up next time, the story of “Randi and the CHAIR”…

# Not talkin’ about women

Rick and Suds story.

_by AK - October 22, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Not talkin’ about women

Tuesday Midday Bed Time Story: Not talkin’ about women.

Most mornings before the Rick and Suds Show I’d stumble in around 4:45 with my mug of coffee, my CD of Smashing Pumpkins or Rage Against the Machine and my headphones, and sit in the empty studio combing through the paper, cutting out articles and highlighting things, pull the Live Copy Folders for the show, finalize the prep folders for any guests we had that day, prepare a copy of the log highlighting when and where certain things ran, laying out a schedule of things we’d planned that day. It didn’t really matter; Rick would show up at 5:58 with his briefcase stuffed with things he’d found since I’d talked to him last, and those would usually trump anything we’d planned. And deservedly so. Most times, if Rick had found an angle on something really good, his enthusiasm would always make it that much better.

Suds would always show up earlier than Rick, around 5:45 or so, and he always had his briefcase filled too, but mostly with snacks like a bag of pretzels and a baloney sandwich. And the TV guide.

Whenever I was done, I would go to the Control Room and sit in one of the chairs in that room and strike up a conversation with whomever was running the board, often times it was about if Larry King had said anything worthy of carting up, or what Rick and Suds had planned for the day. One morning, I around 5:15am, a 14 year old boy popped into the control room. He was homeless waif thin and had the most perfectly coiffed golden locks. He was dressed like any preppy Connecticut toddler would; khaki pants, penny loafers with actual pennies in them, argyle socks and a freshly ironed crisp blue oxford. It’s dark in the control room, (Mike, the blind board op liked it that way.. not that it made a difference to him.. ) and the light shining behind the boy in the doorway gave him and ominous, golden boy appearance.

I’m wearing what most radio people wear.. what they would sitting around the house. I’m in my ripped jeans, t-shirt, flannel around my waist and timberland boots. And the child opens his mouth and speaks.

“Hello. I’m Brian Andrews”

“Hi Brian.. are you lost? Can I help you? Where’s your mommy? ATTENTION SHOPPERS, WE HAVE A LOST CHILD IN THE CONTROL ROOM” I thought..

“Hi” was all I got to utter before he continued.

“I’m doing news this morning for WIOD”

“ohkay”

“Where do I get the weather report and cuts from certain stories?” he asks.

“Follow me” I say as I get up and walk him back to the news room.

“This here is the weather printer” I say, pointing to the dot matrix printer continuously spooling it’s prefolded paper into a box behind it. “The audio cuts come from here” I said pointing to his MS-DOS amber colored font screen. “Find the cut you want, and cart it up here” I said pointing to the built in cart deck.

“Someone’s going to have to do that for me. I don’t have time for that. That’s not my job” he said hinting at me as he breezed past me back to his work station.

“Okay. Good luck with that” I said as I walked out back to the control room.

I tell Mike the story and we laugh saying things like “who’s this kid think he is?” and “Man is he in for a SUPER rude awakening”, and throwing out a few “yessir, bawss. I gets to cartin’ up yo stuffs rites away, suh!”

So to say we didn’t hit it off is an understatement of monumental proportions.

And every half hour Brian would use all his might to pry open the heavy control room door to grab his spots for his newscast and say things like “I have 5 stories, 3 cuts and traffic and weather” like I cared or needed to know that in any way.

“You’re out at 04:55.” And when he hit :04:55 past the hour, even if he was in mid sentence, I played the show open. “Sorry bawss. I gots to hit that open on time, suh” I mumbled to myself. And he’d come in, place the spots on the desk and ask what happened.

“You gotta be timed out better I guess. You’ll get the hang of it soon..I hope”

As soon as Neil came into the control room, I barraged him with the story about the newsroom man-boy. He took one look at Brian when he came in to grab his spots, and looked at me, and laughed.

I guess when the rest of the news staff showed up that day they clued him in a little better… but he was still a fish out of water. We didn’t talk much, only what we had to. It got friendlier, but was still mostly all business.

Fast forward a few weeks later, and Brian and I are on decent speaking terms, though not best buddies by any sense of the imagination. In the middle of the Rick and Suds show, around Brian storms into the control room to tell me we’re going wall to wall, which is non-stop news coverage. They’re taking over the show. An armed hijacker has taken over a bus filled with disabled children, and it’s storming down the Palmetto.

I type onto the screen where the caller names that we have breaking news, throw it to Brian in the newsroom.. I hit the talk-back button twice fast, which clicks off the overhead speakers in the studio to get their attention, take my index finger and grab the bottom of one of my eyes and pull (the symbol for “look at the screen”). Rick reads it, says “Hold on, we have breaking news from the 610 WIOD news center” and I play the breaking news sounder.

And Brian launches into the story. He’s watching Channel 7 coverage from their helicopter as they follow the bus. Rick flips on the TV in the studio and I do in the control room. And Brian is doing play by play..and he’s not half bad. Until..

He starts mentioning roads. Because he’s new. And he has no idea where the bus is. So when roads like the Palmetto curve, he assumes theyre on a new highway.

“They’re headed East on 95.”

Wait, whut?

Rick and I and Suds are all looking at each other as this continues. And we’re not only laughing, we’re embarrassed for the station. And for Brian. Rick jumps in.

“Brian, that looks like they’re still on the Palmetto”

“Okay, yes, they Palmetto Expressway. Heading east. Wait, no west.”

Soon after it all ends, with Rick and Suds and Neil and Brian all on air together.

And that was kinda the ice breaker to get Brian to be one of us. SHAME. We all suffered it, and as long as Brian tried to be that “I’m better. I’m a NEWSMAN(boy)” attitude, he was never going to be one of the group.

It wasn’t long after that that he started loosening up the top button of his oxford and recording news drops like “We’re not talkin’ about women!” and “Polly wanna cracker?”

One Friday afternoon after my nap, I wake up around 2pm and head to my balcony. I live in a 5 story building across the street from WIOD. I’d first lived in a studio, then shared an apartment with another producer, then when I got the Rick and Suds gig had enough cash to get my own one bedroom apartment. And I’d paid extra for the bay view, looking across at downtown Miami. It was a spectacular bachelor pad. I had a trellis and all kinds of plants on the balcony making it a tropical paradise out there.. the plants, the view of the water and and skyline all lit up at night… It was awesome.

And I step out into the tropical garden in my underwear to smoke, drink coffee, and enjoy the magnificence of my life, and a waterfall of water comes pouring over the balcony, drenching my whole patio, soaking my plants with soapy water, extinguishing my cigarette in the ashtray and covering the entire area with dirty water mixed with clinched out smokes in the ashtray and mud from knocked over plants.

“HEY! WHAT THE FUCK!” and I hear the door close on the balcony above.

I go back to my room, clean myself off and dress while chugging my coffee, then STORM upstairs. I knock on the door rapidly, but not too hard. I want them to answer. I have no clue who my upstairs neighbors are but they’re gonna meet me RIGHT FRICKING NOW that’s for godddam sure.

I knock again.

“justaminute” I hear muffled from inside.

And the door cracks open, and lo-and-behold, it’s Brian goddam Andrews.

“Dude, WTF?”

“Hey Adam!” You live in the building?”

“Yeah dude. Apparently I’m your goddam downstairs neighbor. The one you just fucking showered with a goddam waterfall over your balcony, onto mine with dirty fucking soapy water”

“Ohh I’m sorry. My mom came over and is cleaning.”

“Well isn’t that goddam nice of her. Do me a favor and tell her when the 10 gallons of water she just dumped onto your balcony leaves goes over the edge, it doesn’t magically disappear. It soaks me, my plants, all my shit, then leaves and lands on the people below me.”

“I’m sorry. I’ll tell her. Wanna come in?”

“No thanks.”

And I head back down the hall.

The next day, we turned it into a bit on air, ragging on Brian about his mommy coming over to clean his house. “She do yer laundry too, Brian?” “She did a nice job of ironing today, Brian”. “What did mommy pack you for lunch today?” “

The next Friday when I awake from my nap and head outside, the balcony is drowned again. Brian’s mom had once again cleaned, but earlier during my nap.

I took the ashtray, filled with 20 smokes, the ash/mud and water, leaned over my railing, and lobbed the entire thing onto his balcony and the rugs she’d hung over the side. Black and tan ash mud dribbled down the white mat.

And Brian’s mom never Niagra’d my balcony again.

A few months later Brian was gone from WIOD, (off to Channel 7 where he belonged) and out of the crappy apartment building we lived in. And I honestly can say that I was a little sad.. sad for me because he was good for ragging on at WIOD…and sad for the next person he lived above.

# Randi banned from Disney's New York

What did Randi do at Disney's New York?

_by AK - July 27, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Randi banned from Disney's New York

Saturday Night Bedtime story: Randi banned from Disney’s New York.

Very often the fine, fine folks from Disney pay to have radio station’s come broadcast live from their theme parks. It’s usually as part of an advertising buy for some special thing they’re doing, and stations usually take them up on it because the whole gansa-mishpucha from the station gets to go and take part in being treated like royalty by Disney hospitality. Free food, free stays at their nicest properties, tons of free merchandise, etc. Marketing wise, they get it. They treat their media partners like gold because it’s worth the weight of that gold when the broadcasters start talking about how amazing everything is. The term “mickey mouse operation” can be used for many many organizations; the “house of the mouse” ain’t one of them.

Disney between Turkey Day and New Year’s is an especially saccharine time of year… sweet enough to cause tooth decay, what with all the decorations and happy holidays stuff going on. And it’s a great time of year to promote that stuff, so the whole station got sent up there to do their shows on Friday from their Disney Studios booth where many radio stations do their shows from a real radio studio inside the park, with double paned glass looking out at the streets filled with Disney Holiday revelers. Tons and tons of kids just in heaven, and parents loving the fact that they brought their kids to the :Happiest place in the world” at the happiest time of the year… all safe and secure in non-stop wonderment.

Between Thanksgiving and New Years, about 2 weeks after the Macy’s Day Parade, all those floats are trucked down to Orlando where they’re set up around the NEW YORK street setup in Disney’s Hollywood (now MGM) Studios. And either the Disney folks or the Sales guys had a great idea to have Randi broadcast LIVE from New York street in the middle of the park during her Saturday show from like 8a-noon. I mean, why not? New York chick on New York Street with the Macy’s Day Parade floats all around? Why NOT! What a great idea!

Neither of them had apparently ever listened to her show.

First of all.. Randi didn’t only frequently bite the hand that fed her, she shit into it afterward.

Here’s how it went down as I remember. We have to be there, set up at a table at 7:30 so we can go on the air at 8. And it’s a cold day, and the sun hasn’t cleared the faux buildings, so we’re in the shade, in 60 degree weather with a stiff 15 mph wind at 8am. And already Randi isn’t happy.

We go on the air, and … we’re the only ones there. On an empty street in the back of the Hollywood Studios thee park. “Broward! owardowardoward” Echos. The park isn’t even open for another hour, and we’re in a closed empty part of the park broadcasting live. To no one. On a saturday morning. at 8am.

And Randi starts being Randi. Comically bitching about this and that, talking to callers about how cold, and miserable, and yelling as loud as she can so you can year the echo on the air. After an hour or so, when the park eventually opened, people eventually started making their way to the back of the place… random parents pushing strollers and Randi is talking about coffee farts and Jim’s schlong and her nipples being hard from the whipping wind… and there, on the street, is the Disney Marketing folks… who aren’t happy. They apparently ever heard her show before, and the Sales guys hadn’t clued them in. They’d expected New York Randi having a warm homecoming feeling about being in New York for the Holidays, and they got Queen Kong scaring the bajeezus out of the children. So they talk to someone, who talks to someone, and they have us turn down the monitors a little so the audio isn’t so loud as to be in violation of Disney rules for crassness and obscenity.

Well, that pushed Randi over the edge. She starts looking around at all the festive decorations adorning the fake NY Skyline windows and starts complaining about how there are no menorahs in any of the goddam windows. “They got JEWS in real New York. I don’t see a one in this place”.. and that goes on for about 30 minutes. At one point she threatened to make Disney’s NY look a little more authentic by offering to take a dump on the sidewalk.

And that was that. They wanted to pull the plug on the show. I think I remember Boy Gary getting involved in some kind of angry shouting/discussion with the Disney marketing folks (i was too busy paying attention to what I had to do with the show) and the result was that there were to be NO monitors playing the show while we were live on the street. People would walk by and see a lady at a table with a headphone and mic on, but they couldn’t hear a word she said. She couldn’t talk to any passers by, only to the few callers who bothered to ring in, and she killed the time talking to me and Jim in relative radio silence within the confines of the Disney park.

Not surprisingly, the next time when Rick and Suds and Phil were invited to do shows from the Magic Kingdom, Randi was left out of the promotion.

# Randi's Chair

What happened to the Randi's chair?

Special Edition Sunday Night Bedtime Horror Story

No mystery in this one.. many many people already knows how this one ends.. but here’s what I remember from that night.

Normal night on the Randi Rhodes show.. few calls and basically Randi having to talk to herself, or Jim, or me for 3 hours. No wonder she went crazy. A caller from Bubba the pre-teen violin player in Tampa. Some yenta from Boca to tell her how much of a breath of fresh air she is… some lonely dude who used to follow her around anywhere she went on his scooter (Al Rogers this means YOU).. the usual night chronics..

So I’m in the control room answering the phones, loading the spot and promo carts… rolling reel-to-reel tape… talking occasionally on the air or off air in the overhead monitor depending on what i wanted to tell her. Jim is doing what he usually did.. sit in the studio with her. That’s about it. They’d talk, or fight, or laugh during breaks while she plucked her eyelashes out with her fingers. Yes, she really did that.

There’s double pane 4 foot high by 8 foot wide window looking into the studio… and while spinning 360s in the control room between the phone or the tapes or the carts, I’d keep one eye n the studio in case Randi, or Jim tried to catch my attention…

Jim often would come into the control room just to see what I was up to, or shoot the shit, or clue me in on something that was bugging Randi so I’d be aware/forewarned. Or he’d wander around the building, or go get her soda or candy or whatever. He was he do-boy for anything I couldn’t or wouldn’t do. In most cases, I had to and did.

Randi’s doing her normal craziness.. She’s wearing a brown and yellow flowered sun dress and those Sally Jessie Raphael glasses of hers.. gesticulating into the air, pounding on the desk, yelling “BROWARD!” etc. I give her the break sign for the top of the hour as the out music rolls on…, she goes to commercial, and hits the talk back and asks Jim to come in there. Jim stamps out his Parliment light in the ashtray (not only could you smoke in the studio back then, but you could actually purchase cigs in the vending machine down stairs. They were just loaded into the machine in those coil thingies next to the chips.. $2.25 a pack!.. But as always, I digress..

So I’m half paying attention, one eye on the spot carts running, changing reels out, looking at the blinking on-hold lights… and I see Randi stand up and start bunching her sundress… and Jim heads to where she’s sitting behind the desk… and Randi exits the studio and heads out the door. Jim is snickering, but he also looks a little wigged out. He too exits the studio and asks if I have any paper towel and cleaner.. I do what I always did in these situations.. I opened up the cupboard where Reineri’s producer stashed his stuff, everything labeled with “NO TOUCH!” and handed him the paper towel and spray cleaner.

“Randi spill coffee again?” I ask.

“Not exactly” replies Jim as he leaves the control room to head back to the studio.

Randi comes back to the studio, her dress soaked wet all across the lower half. Jim is dragging her chair from behind the desk, and putting a different one in its place. He grabs the chair with the spill on it, and gets ready to start wiping and spraying… the hourly show open starts to play.. Jim drags the chair into the middle of the room, and Randi hits the off-air talk back button and asks if I can come in and help Jim.

I remove my headset, hop out of my chair, and head into the studio.. Jim is handing me the paper towel to mop up what he’s spraying on it…

“Whadja spill?” I ask as I grab the roll.

“I had my period”. i look at the black chair with blue and mauve tiny squares all over it… theres a dark, slick stain running front to back of the seat. It looked like a crime scene. I drop the roll, leave the biohazzardous area, and go back into the control room.

Jim is rubbing and scrubbing as best as he can. I cant even look. I’m sure Randi was mortified, but she didn’t show it. She just finished the show, laughing off air with me and Jim, trying to lighten the mood.

If it were me I woulda taken that chair out back and thrown it in the dumpster. But they just left it there. And it stayed there, in the one never used sitting area under the dry erase board and clock, and all it was ever used for was for standing on to update the totals of the charity drive.

And thats how the Scarlet Chair came to be, and remain.

at least that’s how I remember it…

Sleep tight.

The Sale of WIOD – Part 1

Saturday Night Bedtime Story – Good Night, You Princes of The Causeway, You Kings of South Florida

PART ONE: The Meeting

On fine day, one that started like many others, just before the end of the Rick and Suds Show and prior to Neil going on the air, management told us we were holding a company meeting, and it was mandatory for everyone to attend.

Oh, and it’s not in the conference room, it was going to be in the building right across the street in the office building over there. We’d never been there before. Little did we know that several weeks later, we’d never be back to the “Wonderful Isle of Dreams”.

Immediately everyone is gossiping and the building is abuzz.. All hidden and whispery. It was the kinda thing that Neil would have mentioned off hand during the show, but it wasn’t his primary discussion that day. He’d just reference it.

But me, and the rest of the producers were just wildly speculating..

“They’re bringing in Howard to do Mornings, Rick and Suds go back to afternoons, Phil goes back to nights.” “No dude.. We’re buying another station” “They’re finally gonna put us on FM!” “Meh.. Maybe it’s just Bob Greene leaving”

Frankly, I was so caught up in it all that frankly, I don’t remember whether the meeting was during Neil’s show and they put “best of” tapes on,, or whether they waited for Phil to be on and held the meeting then, since he wasn’t part of the sale anyway.

And the the time came, the entire building went across the street. Oh, did I say “the entire building”? My bad. Sorry.JUST WIOD. The Coast and WHQT weren’t invited. And It wasn’t just the air staff.. It was programming, promotions, sales, everyone. And honestly, I remember the walk over there being filled with office laughter from groups of friends, walking in happy little groups on the way to the slaughter.

We walk in to this building we’ve never been to, and fill a conference room. It’s so full that people are not just sitting in every seat, they’re lined around the perimeter. And the mumbling and talking gets louder and people are at ease. And Bob Green steps to the front of the room. He’s there with another guy I didn’t recognize, and he introduced him as Bob Neil who was some vice president of Cox or whatever. JUST TELL US ALREADY dude! Are we going on FM or WHAT?

“A business decision has been made and COX has decided to sell WIOD…”

And he points to another, older man I didn’t recognize. Button down shirt and tie, slacks, dress shoes. “To Paxson Communications.”

BOOM.

All the air leaves the room, as 60 people all inhale/gasp.

I’d never seen him before. Never heard him speak before. But his speech didn’t leave me feeling scared or worried about the religious stuff, or the station’s future, or even my job. I was an optimist back in those days. I had wide-eyed hopes that maybe this would be a good thing. They were gonna build a brand new major studio for us. A new owner could mean new opportunities. The sale of WIOD, when it was all complete, is one of the story-lines in my life that ended wide-eyed optimism. Santa, Tooth Fairy, Sale of WIOD. Not in that order.. But I digress, and I’m getting ahead of myself.

Neil, Rick and Suds stay. Phil is staying with COX. Newsroom is being dismantled. Canes, Dolphins, gone. We’re keeping a few of the Sports department, for now. This guy goes with WIOD, that guy stays. She’s staying but he’s leaving. We could be out in as soon as 30 days, so start packing, Thank you.

And the meeting ends, and we walk back to the station, much slower, heads lower.

And over the next few weeks, we boxed up 50 years worth of stuff, and prepared to have our parent company cut the cord, and hand us to an adoptive parent.. A strange, crazy, weird, dangerously unaware parent.

Monday Afternoon Bedtime Story: The Sale of WIOD – Part 2

“Woeful Interstate Of Doom”

After the sale was finalized and we were given 30 days to vacate the “Wonderful Isle of Dreams”, packing started really moving forward. None of the studio equipment was coming with us except the DCS. We could take the carts and reels. And anything “show” related we could carry.

And I mean literally carry, because no moving trucks would be coming. We either had to use our own cars or make trips in the one station van.

And over the course of a few weeks while we packed and said goodbyes to more than half our family, the busy bees known as the “Engineering Department” for Paxson Communications was working on building us new, state of the art, gigantic studios for us.

_Inside a building already occupied by a mid-size marketing company we’d share the facilities with that hadn’t been redecorated since 1982._

But ok, so what, we’d have new neighbors.. So still.. The huge, state of the art brand-spankin-new studios.

_Without any of the equipment we wanted or needed. “Reel to reel machines? Cart decks? Sorry… we’re digital now. Here’s DAT tapes and a new computer system.” Uhm, excuse me but without cart decks, how are we supposed to get that stuff off the carts to put into the computers? - “DOH! ROYYY!”_

Ok, ok, I’m being nit picky, right? BEAUTIFUL, STATE of the ART Facilities.

_15 miles away from the offices occupied by the rest of the radio stations in the Paxson Miami chain. So twice a week, for meetings or other reasons, or to sign paperwork, or whatever reason, we’d have to drive there. To a place nobody knew us, recognized or cared about us._

“oh, that sounds like a GOOD thing no?” you’re probably thinking.

_Yeah, except that the speakers in the ceiling piped in the PS system from the other building. So all day, while you were sitting in the open closet editing audio (yes, it really was an open closet door with a desk in it), you’d hear “Max Sitero report to the PlanetRadio studio please.” “Andy McGee, your wife is at the front desk”. “Hello? Hello? Wait this thing is on?”…. But I digress… Back to the move._

So the day comes, Saturday, and it’s moving day.. And me, and Jorge, and Wayne, and Fajita and Steve Speier, and Mark Hoffman and a bunch of other station soldiers load up their cars and the van for multiple trips to the new digs. And we make 4 or 5 trips like that, back and forth….then spend the evening and much of the next day setting up our various areas. Jorge’s got 2000 carts, 1000 reel-to-reels to organize A – ZZZ. I have a bullhorn, a 12 gallon bucket, and 3 racks of carts to start putting in place. The sports guys have a production desk at the end of a dead-end hallway. The continuity and traffic people are all crammed into a room that occasionally locks people in there. And we’re all responsible for carrying things and getting the place ready to function.

But the studios ARE beautiful, and brand spankin new and top notch.. If only things would work. Engineering had as much time as it took us to pack and move to put together all of these new studios, with equipment and boards and wiring everything and testing everything. I don’t think Roy and Max and Leno had ever built a talk studio, so the little things that we would need were left out or we’d have to fight for.. (like cart decks)… “Why would you need to have more than one call on the air? We didn’t hook it up to do that”. Yeah, I’m sure at “All Chick Rock-All The Time PLANET Radio they don’t take many phone calls. We do. Get it done, ROY. Oh, and while you’re at it, how about making sure we can dial OUT, okay? We do that some times, okay? If you have any issues, talk to the Program Director”

And within a month or 2 of being on the air from that terrible building (only by comparison to what we’d had prior) most of the things were working…. Technically. What wasn’t working? The station. There were so many gaps and open shifts that we seriously started believing that Nichol would rollerblade around on Miami Beach and ask people if they wanted to do a radio show. We still don’t know, to this very day, where he found “The Sheik”. My guess? Park bench on the Causeway.

So as quickly as they announced the sale, they blew out the PD Steve Nichol.. And brought in the Brain Trust, aka Harry “Penis” Valentine (aka the Program Director) and Walt Sabo (aka the Consultant). These two guys are as responsible as Buddy Bud for the demise of the station.

And here’s why: It’s the talent that matters. People aren’t listening for the goofy, campy time checks on the 1’s (10:01, 10:11, 10:21, 10:31, 10:41) and people aren’t listening for the self-aggrandizing, ego maniacal, pregnant woman punching, wanna be comic news guy. The station was best when it was a SEROUS NEWS AND SPORT STATION that had hosts that were a break from that. There was limited crossover, and much goofing on the news and the sports and the weather and the traffic… but it was like Neil or Rick and Suds hijacked the serious station and took calls before the serious news guy could come back into the room. But once Harry and Walt showed up, not only were the news folks PURPOSELY trying to not just be funny (like “Florida’s pot’s not good, it’s GREAT”) but now all the sounders and music and time checks and traffic guys and weather reports and everything was this schlocky, campy, 1960’s goofy throwback nonsense. Trust me.. Go back and listen to any of the dying days of that station on the uploaded shows the great folks on this Facebook page have uploaded. Just LISTENING to them now I still wince with the absolute destructiveness of that disaster. So sad. Check out that 1997 Rick and Suds show.. ouch..painful to listen to, and I’m not just talking about the Rick and Suds part. Listen to it. everything else on that tape.. THAT’s what killed WIOD…

And every week or so, Bud and his cronies would come visit their red-headed step child at their satellite location on the side of I-95… and talk to us about things that clearly illustrated his total lack of understanding about the business. When you say things so stupid that even the Sales Department laughs and the idiocy of what was said, you KNOW it was dumb. One of the things that stuck out, and Neil used to talk about was Bud’s “PEAKS OF 20 SHARES!” comment. “We don’t want to have good ratings all the time” he’d said.. “we want you to have okay numbers, then PEAKS of 20 SHARES!”. Like that would help the sales department sell the station? They sell based on how many people are usually listening… not what we might get lucky with a peak here and there.

And not long after that, Neil announced he was leaving.

Next, Part 3 – Neil’s waning days, the slow painful death of WIOD and the start of the SuperTalk Radio Network.

_Part 3 was either never completed or recovered._

# Sandbagged, Barfbagged, Nichol-bagged

WIOD radio story.

_by AK - August 20, 2013_

Tuesday Midday Bedtime Story: Sandbagged, Barfbagged, Nichol-bagged

Larry King was right when he said “The worst talk radio is on WIOD”, but only if he was talking about morning drive on a fateful day in 1996.

Everyone hates best-of tapes… until a guest host fills in… then they love them. SO I pitched Program Director Steve Nichol on doing a mix of both when Rick and Suds went on vacation one week. We’d play Best Of tapes, but before just launching into them, I’d come on, give a little background on the bit, or what the deal was, if needed, then play the segments. And if we got a call I’d take it on the air, maybe take a request, but largely, it was best of tapes.

“I like it” said gravelly voiced, mustachio’d Nichol-bag. And that was the plan. “Only, don’t tell Neil or Rick and Suds”

Uhhh.. “Okay, but I already kinda told Rick and Suds what I was pitching… you know…some best ofs with like me doing the background stuff, maybe take a request”

“Yeah yeah, okay, but don’t make a big deal out of it…It’s just tapes… don’t get Neil and anyone all worked up” he grated with his over-charred vocal chords.

And that was that.

I prepared the tapes, 4 hours worth each day for a full week in preparation. That’s 4 reel to reel tapes each day, one for each hour, times 5. Twenty total hours. All set for the following week.

I was pretty calm about the whole thing. After all, it’s not like I’d never been on the air… Payphone challenges, discussions with Randi and Rick&Suds on a plethora of subjects and issues… and frankly, anyone who sat in the control room, aside from Jorge, did their own show anyways with the callers. Jorge only asked you for the city you were calling from, and put you on hold. “Neil Rogers Show… What City are you calling from?” and if he recognized your voice as a chronic, CLICK… he hung up. Everyone else prepped their callers. Name, city, whatcha wanna talk about… the idea was to get them focused on what they wanted to say so that when they got on the air, they could launch right into it… at least that’s the premise. Nothing worse than hearing that “FVVVVVT” noise as the host says “Kendal, Hello?” and the caller says “Uhhh… ” before hanging up. It’s also a good way to have them practice telling someone what they wanna say before doing it for the world to hear. Or, winding them up so crazy that by the time they get on air they’re an absolute humorous mess. So we were all pretty decent at talking to strangers on the phone. Throw in that every one of us who at one time worked the overnight shift, had the pleasure of screwing with the Larry King Show by slipping in a drop of him laughing, often at an inappropriate time, just to get the timing of such things down. “Hello, ma’am… Tell us about the tragedy of being one of Saddam Hussain’s concubines… Hah-hah, hah-hah. Uh-huh”. But I digress…

Friday after the show, after R&S leave after the show and for a full week’s vacation, Nichol calls me into his office.

“Listen…” he grunts… “No tapes. You just do the show”

If “LOL” had been a phrase then, I would have said it. “Wait, whut? Me?”

“Yeah.. No tapes. The audience hates tapes. They know you. Yer funny. Just go in there and take calls and talk about stuff”

“Uhh… okay.”

He’s the boss.. What was I gonna say? “Hey thanks, but I’m only 26 years old and I’m not even in the prime demo for this station and I have no business in morning drive on WIOD”? I know, I know..I should have.

So that night, and the next, end even the next after that, I didn’t sleep. And by the time Monday morning at 4am came around, I was a zombie. My head was spinning. I was chomping on tums and chugging Pepto Bismol out of cocktail glasses. I arrived at the station (I drove, even though I lived LITERALLY across the street) and started prepping while the producer Wayne and Laen from The Coast helped me prepare.

And as the clock ticked down to 6:05am, I was dizzy, tired, exhausted and nauseous. And as the Rick and Suds Show open fades, I, in my infinite wisdom, open with Rage Against the Machine screaming as loud as humanly possible “WAAAAAAKKKKKEEEE UPPPPPPPPPP…..WAAAAAAKKKKKKEEEE UPPPPPPP”

People slowly arising from their slumbers must have been jolted from their beds and were clutching the ceilings by fingers and toes like a scared cat. And I was yelling just as loud, with my high-pitched whiny voice… talking 200 miles per hour from the 3 pots of coffee I’d had in the last 4 minutes. Nothing made sense. Calls came in from regular Rick and Suds callers to say “hi” and I just hung up on them in mid sentence while I chewed tums like Pez into the microphone. Sentences ran on and on and on in a singular breath for 7 minutes at a time while I vaulted over 23 different topics. Wayne and Laen kept yelling into my headphones to calm down… and I’d just repeat whatever they said into the microphone. It was a disaster. At one point I retched into the garbage can while a caller asked me to play a bit. And the whole time…for 3 and a half hours… I worried about one thing….

9:30am.

When Neil would normally stroll in, and sit with Rick and Suds while he read the paper.

And in walks Neil. And he puts the paper down. And he looks at me, with the mic in my hand, and my voice in the overhead speakers, and he sits down.

I don’t remember much after that. I remember Neil being very calm, pulling up a microphone, and asking me in that sing-songy way he often addressed me… like I was a little kid.. “How’s it GOIN Ahhhdam?”

But that was about all he offered. I didn’t expect much else. I knew it was a radio abortion… I’m a pretty goddam bright individual with a high IQ.. So it wasn’t a surprise when the shift finally ended, and Neil, who’d been silent during the past half hour got up to sit in his rightful place in the chair I’d been warming. And as the newscast was happening, as Neil was getting his carts and Cds ready, I told him the deal about the original pitch, and how Steve had asked me to just do the show. I couldn’t even listen to Neil that day out of sheer embarrassment for myself… but when I did, he was humorously yet kindly ripping me and ass… but Steve Nichol even more for sandbagging me.

Not surprisingly, later that day after I awoke from my regular afternoon nap I had a voice mail from Steve Nichol. It was 4 words.

“Tomorrow, just play tapes”

# Randi's Departure

Randi's Rhodes leaves WIOD.

_by AK - August 15, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Randi's Departure

Thursday Midday Bedtime Story: Randi’s departure; a slow speed chase.

As always, all I can do is offer up what I remember from all those years ago… anyone with other, more, or better information is always free to correct me….

Randi joined WIOD in September of 1992 after Hank Goldberg told the Program Director to copulate with himself because he (Hank) didn’t want to do any more Hurricane Andrew related shows a month after the storm. My guess is, as was common practice, that after she won over everyone, they gave her a 1 year contract for the job, with a 1 year extension if the company wanted to keep her. So 2 years later, in June of 1994, it was renegotiating time. And Randi wasn’t the unemployed former trucker anymore.. She was the successful nighttime host on WIOD who’d made a name for herself. So when it came time to renegotiate, it wasn’t Randi and Jim handling it, it was Howard Stern’s agent now. So Randi had absolutely no interest in being pushed around. She was going to ask for whatever she deserved, and wasn’t going to back down. And she had the pit bull of all agents to handle it all for her.

The problem was that the show, and the station was costing a fortune to keep operating. Millions to the Dolphins, Canes, Reineri, Rick and Suds, Neil, a news staff of 20+, a stable of producers and board ops… and now the night show wants a Lexus and a house with a pool and a private bathroom and a helicopter? Unlikely. When you’re Neil, and have his ratings, and his audience, and his endorsement, you can ask for more than what you want and get it, because you deliver a humongous audience who’s buying power is worth it. But Randi? On at 8pm? Talking about her vaginal secretions and Jim’s bowels? Good luck.

And don’t forget…not too long before Randi got shafted when they put her in afternoon drive as Rick and Suds went to mornings, then after a few weeks they gave the slot to newcomer Phil Hendrie and Randi got sent back to the darkness of nights. So she was ready to rake them over the coals if they wanted to keep her. Good for her! Good for me.

The negotiating table is a dance. And it’s not nice. It’s like a divorce proceeding where couples try and stay together fighting over every little thing in order to remain married. “You get saturdays off, I get to pay you less money” - “No, I get saturdays off, and you have to get me a car endorsement within 3 months” - “No, You can have saturdays off, but we’re going to change your shift to midnight”…on and on and on, all done thru lawyers and agents over mailed correspondence that takes weeks and months. Its really very nerve-racking and can drive you crazy. And Randi didn’t have far to go to begin with. But she was having success, and felt she deserved more than she was making, and deserved to be treated more like the talent she was, and most of all, I think she wanted their respect. Sadly, in a negotiation, that’s the last thing they’ll give you. You’re a cog in a machine. You’re one part of a much bigger picture, and if this wheel squeaks too much and requires too much maintenance, you eventually replace it….

Unless, behind the scenes, the wheel is getting offers to wok in a much smaller machine, with much less daily grinding and pounding, so you don’t need to squeak any more.

Which is exactly what Randi did.

For weeks now Randi had not only been driving herself crazy, she was driving everyone around her crazy, Jim and myself included. Because when Randi isn’t happy, or comfortable, or secure, or self confident, nobody around her can feel happy, or comfortable, or secure, or self confident. She’d been giving me updates here and there on the status of it all, and although I wasn’t involved in any way, shape or form, I really didn’t care much either way. Stay or go. I have a job either way, and there were benefits to both outcomes. Stay and we go back to doing the night show, which despite the craziness, was still, at times, enjoyable…or.. Leave and I get a new host to try and work with.

Meanwhile, the whole Nicole Brown/Ronald Goldman murder story, only a few days/weeks old, was a regular topic on the show leading up to that fateful night. And in prep for the show that evening, a Friday Night Show, I;d done my normal stuff… carting up clips, preparing new sound effects, gotten all my tapes and stuff ready, etc

Around 5p, Randi walked in.. With Jim.. Walked right into the studio, grabbed a few things, stopped to tell me she was done at WIOD, she’d turned down their offer and decided to take a job in West Palm Beach at WJNO. I wasn’t surprised at all. She’d mentioned on several occasions doing that, talking to different stations, etc. Now that she was on the map at WIOD, it wasn’t like she was spinning Bon Jovi records any more.. She was a full fledged talk show host, with a record and ratings. So again, I wasn’t surprised at all. She said goodbye, we hugged, I shook Jim’s hand, said good-luck, and they walked out. And Randi and Jim were gone, off to the hoity-toity world of Palm Beach.

The End.

Sort of.

Because Ultimately, Randi kinda had the last laugh in it all.

The Program Director told me later that we’d be running Best of Randi that night; he didn’t tell me that Randi was gone for good, but I don’t think he thought I didn’t know. He just told me matter-of-factly. “Run Best of’s”

Okay.

What a shame, though… earlier that afternoon in California, at a press conference, the Police announced that OJ Simpson was a suspect, and was wanted for questioning. Randi would have had a blast with this one.

When the Bronco chase started and all networks went to it live, we had on Best of Randi Rhodes tapes of her talking to Bubba the teen fiddle player calling in from Tampa, highlights of her interview with and performance of Kipp Winger in studio, an assortment of old monologues (much of her show was a monologue since she didn’t get a ton of calls), and the like. Jackie Bales, the spritely blonde news woman was only scheduled to do news at the top and bottom of the hour, but the phones, tonight of all nights, were now ringing off the hook. So I spoke with Jackie and we agreed that she’d go on the air every 15 minutes with updates…

So while the world watched Al Cowlings drive a white bronco at 20 mph down a California interstate with former All-Star Heisman Trophy winner now wanted accused murderer OJ Simpson in the back seat with a wad of cash and a gun to his head, tailed by 45 police cars, 3 helicopters, and people lining up on foot along the highway to wave and hold up signs saying “RUN JUICE, RUN!”, on News Talk WIOD you heard Randi popping the cherry (“squeeeeeek-POP!”) of a 58 year old man calling in to talk about his psoriasis, and Randi doing impressions of her jewish mother.

# Miami's Own, Scotty Mac

Scott Macollough aka Scotty Mac was the sports producer for WIOD.

Sunday Night Bedtime Story: Miami’s Own, Scotty Mac

Scott Macollough aka Scotty Mac was the sports producer for WIOD. He was responsible for carting up audio clips, occasionally booking guests, answering phones and running the board during SportTalk610, weeknight 6-8pm before Goldberg At Night, then Randi Rhodes, then Chris Baker, then Passion Phones. So he was in the building most days 3p - 9p. Which meant Neil rarely saw him, but everyone else did, sandwiched between Rick and Suds and whatever show was on at night.

For most of his tenure SportsTalk610 had a round table of hosts.. Defo, MadDog, Bokamper, Zagack-ack-acki. Even Sonny Hirsh when Hurricane Hotline would take over the show on Thursday nights during the UM season.

Scotty, or Mac, or Smack or whatever anyone called him, was the biggest happy-go-lucky elf you ever saw. Ears like radar dishes on a pin sized head tacked atop his 5’8 135lb frame, was THE biggest sports nerd I’ve ever met. He wasn’t just a kid who watched a lot of sports; he was the kind that would read the MLB rule book each year. He was pretty straight laced; his father was the head-honcho over at public TV’s WLRN, so he didn’t really fit in the the rest of the slacker clowns like me, Jorge, Marvin, or Manny or Alex Rodriguez or David Waggener, or “Fajita” Ray Trujillo, or “The Piercer” Steven Spierer or anyone else in the producer roll. But he was such a good natured odd-ball that we’d include him whenever we thought his weirdness was a plus to whatever we were doing.. which was often.

Let me back up a second and remind folks that in those days, in radio in general, it wasn’t as corporate as it is now. The sales suits and programming suits RAN the place, but the 20-somethings like me had the RUN OF the place. It didn’t matter that I was running the board from 11pm to 6am and was only being paid for that… I was AT THE BUILDING at 1pm to help out or take part in whatever was going on. Neil needs someone to go run and get Florias? I’m on it. Marvin needs someone to run the board when he goes on payphone challenge? Ok. Mitch Lewis needs someone to make the sound effect of someone vomiting into a garbage can? I volunteer. That’s how things like the “Johnny Dark’s an Asshole” cart came about… 3 or 4 of us were hanging out in a production room around 10pm, screwing around with the voice changer, and I sang that out. People laughed, we carted it up, and left it for Neil. That’s just how it worked. But I digress…

Scotty was a s-t-r-a-n-g-e bird, I tellya. He had these incredibly thin hands with long fingers, and punctuated his sentences and gave words emphasis with them the way Brad Pitt does playing a nutjob in the movie “12 Monkeys” with a huge smile on his face. he had a really high pitched and raspy voice to go along with those hands, and those ears, and that frame and that personality. I’ve never met a more caricaturistic live person ever.

So you’d say “I’m going on a date tonight”, and Scotty would point at you, and in that raspy high pitched voice with a Cheshire cat grin say “ahh haa HAAH!”. And so, one night, we got Scotty to record that drop.

When something super cool would happen he was fond of exclaiming “TREMENDOUS!”. Cart it up!

One night, we’re eating chinese food, and Scotty sees us, and goes to do his normal “ahh haa HAAH!” and gives it Chinese language flavoring, and out bursts “HEE HAWW HEEE”…

STOP. EVERYTHING. GET IN THE PRODUCTION ROOM NOW. And we had him record like 5 different versions of that. Rick and Suds start playing the clips, and before you know it, the audience is calling in to do their own versions of it. Burping. On helium. As the Pope. Farting. Drowning.

I’m not exactly sure where “I did that one time, when I was about 15 years old” but I can be absolutely sure that it happened much the same way.

And everyone got their own Scotty Mac style nickname: I was “Lanky Kirschbaum”.

One Christmas, Scotty sent out invitations to us because his family was having a holiday party at their house, and he invited us to it. Some of us brought dates, others just came intending to drink their asses off. After searching for his house in this super nice neighborhood, i finally found it; Scotty is standing at the end of the driveway looking like one of those lantern jockey thingies with a lantern in his hand. Only he’s wearing a black jacket.. with a white turtleneck under it. It’s like 85 degrees out, and he’s dressed like a Crispin Glover character, and i roll down the window and in his best preppy palm-beach, clenched teeth Biff impressions says “Wel-come to myyyyy PARRRRtyyyy”. I park, go in, and even though he’d invited us at like 9pm, apparently we were invited as the after party his family had thrown for their own friends. All the trays of food had crumbs on them. We didn’t care; the family was SUPER nice, and the house was totally f-ing “Mack”ed out.. ridiculous house. And we ate leftovers and drank before splitting.

After seeing his house, and hearing about how they summered in Vero Beach, we pressed Smack for a year to get a weekend for us all up there. Eventually he capitulated and one weekend, before his family was to stake their summer claim there, he invited us up there and me and my girlfriend, and Marvin and his girlfriend, and Jorge and like 6 other people all drive up there. It was like that scene in Caddyshack when they let all the Caddy’s use the pool.. all these young drunken, stoned riff-raff clamoring up to “MAC’s Landing”. That wasn’t my name for it. It actually said that in a carved driftwood sign at the entrance. It was ON. THE. BEACH. And the place is, again, ridiculously nice.

And people are smoking, and drinking and generally going berserk. Marvin is partying his ass off with his girlfriend listening to the Spin Doctors at like 11 in a bedroom, I’m being a clown and trying to make a bong out of anything I can find, and Jorge Rodriguez is hurling Goldschlager off the balcony. It was awesome. I dont think anyone could remember what Scotty did. he wasn’t much of a partier, so my only memory is of him is being a good host, nursing a can of beer all night and going from guest to guest to schmooze.

I saw Scotty like 2 years ago. In a parking lot. Driving an old car, stuffed with crap and folders and newspapers and magazines and stuff. He said he was coaching a kid’s little league or was an assistant coach at a high school or something. He was still doing some freelance stuff for Defo too. I told him it was great to see him after all this time, and I wished him well. And as he left, he rolled down his window as he went by and yelled “HEE HAWW HEEE!” as he drove away.

# Sundays Mornings (Defo and Garden Guy)

Sunday morning radio story.

_by AK - July 30, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Sundays Mornings (Defo and Garden Guy)

Monday Midday Bedtime Story: Sundays Mornings (Defo and Garden Guy)

I could a probably did these in 2 separate stories, but they kinda go together, because on Sundays, they did.

Sunday morning were a really rare thing. As a part time producer/board-op, you didn’t get to really pick and choose when and with whom you worked for. But I actually requested this time slot, because it was 2 live shows that took a lot of calls, and the two guys I got to work with were such polar opposites, their shows had absolutely nothing to do with each other, and both hosts were incredibly amazingly cool, that I wanted the shift. Even though it meant that on Saturday nights I had to be in bed early enough to be able to get to the station by 5:50am.

Unlike one of the two hosts. Who didn’t go to sleep the night before, and would come straight to the station for his show. But I’ll get back to Defo in a sec.

The first show was The Garden Show, and the host was Chris Rollins who was and I believe still IS the park manager for the Fruit and Spice Park in South Dade. Chris was a cross between Jimmy Buffet, The Crocodile Hunter, and Sam Elliot’s character in The Big Lebowski. He even had the huge mustache.

Chris was a super, super cool dude. I mean, I’m sure as a park manager he’s got charts and graphs and accounts and excel spread sheets and time cards and managing crap to do.. but his passion is growin’ shit and living in the least populated area of Dade county in those days, the Redlands. And he’s like a mid-40’s outdoorsy guy.. showin’ up in his safari pants and well-worn construction boots with socks and a golf shirt. Pretty big guy, too.

So here’s this rugged outdoorsman, taking calls from little old ladies and giving a shit!

“Hellllo CHRIS?!? My begonias are drooping”

And I’d start laughing in the control room… and he’d see me.. and smile and you’d see that huge mustache curl up at the corners.. and he’d go right on and help this little old lady, keep her on the phone for 4 minutes talking about nitrogen, and phosphorous, and watering and sunlight and spiders and mites, and raccoons and iguanas and all this really interesting stuff. I actually wasn’t half BORED by it. It was like… science and stuff.. and the old ladies who called were good for a laugh.

“Helllooo CHRIS?! I have crabs in my garden”. Laugh, smile, mustache… and a scientific explanation of how and why that stuff would happen and how to prevent it.

In the days after Hurricane Andrew, It was important to have SOMEONE come on and talk about damage to plants and trees and stuff, and on the sunday morning after the storm passed, Chris was on the air. He came in wearing all camouflage from head to toe, and had a pistol strapped to one hip, and a machete strapped to the other. See, the storm not only whallopped the Fruit and Spice park, but also much of where he lived in the Redlands. And there was a real threat of looting and break-ins and Chris was rightfully scared for himself and his family.. (I think I remember him having a really beautiful daughter, but this is so long ago I could be incorrect about that). He explained that he’d had to leave his house like 4 hours earlier in his truck just because the roads were so covered in debris, and he was driving in relatively pitch darkness (no power for streetlights) that it took him that long to drive in for the show.

So here’s this cat looking like he’s out of an episode of Duck Dynasty, armed with revolver and blade, calmly taking calls from little old ladies.

“Hellllo CHRIS?? My lawn is still moist”

Each Sunday after the Garden Show was the “Sunday Morning Sportspage with Jeff Deforrest. And the show was exactly what it was called. Defo reading the Sunday Sportpage.

The Garden Guy had all 9 lights blinking and flickering on hold, Defo would come on, and every caller for the first 15 minutes of the show were holdovers calling in about coconuts and carnations. And after the first 15 minutes, he’d hardly get a cal at all.

Defo is a master at doing a call-in show with no callers. Might be the best ever. That guy can TALK. In his sleep if he needs to.

And most Sundays, he was.

The Garden Show ends. The news is on. The News ends. The “Sunday Morning Sportpage Theme is playing. Still no Defo. As the music trails off, in walks Defo, eyes bleeding red, 2 days old beard growth, slaps down a box of Dunkin Donuts and a box of coffee on the control room desk, grabs a paper and strolls into the studio and BAM! He’s on. The audience has no idea that the guy in the control room is sweating and looking up the phone number for the Sports Director… or that the Garden Guy is 5 seconds from having to continue his show and talk about the fertilizer used on NFL fields.

But Defo is Defo. And he does his show for 4 hours without sleep and with a handful of callers and a newspaper. And he’s on a 20 minute tangent about Casablanca that starts regarding a bogus call by an umpire and ends it back at the Dolphins kicker. All seamlessly interwoven and without a pause.

And me? I’m in the control room stuffing my gullet with 3 jelly donuts and a huge coffee, amused by calls and character and feeling sorry for the guy who’s coming in after me to run Meg Green’s show and the Best of Goldberg at Night.

# Chronic Review - The Fanny Pack Guy

Overview of WIOD chronic - The Fanny Pack Guy

_by AK - July 24, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Chronic Review - The Fanny Pack Guy

Wednesday Afternoon Examination: The Chronic known as “The Fanny Pack” guy.

This one’s really short. And so was The Fanny Pack Guy.

He probably stands like 5’6. Always wearing tight jogging shorts, though his egg-shaped body indicated he didn’t do much jogging. And a headband. And.. a fanny pack, long after the mid 80s fad had gone the way of disco records and people had been embarrassed to the point of ceasing to admit ownership, he proudly wore it, strapped firmly around his middle.

He was always very friendly, happy, smiley. He was just always there. And unlike many of the chronic miscreants, he was nice, waited in line to get his autograph and say hi to Neil, talking until we moved him along. It didn’t matter that Neil had seen him 2 days earlier at a different remote; he talked and talked and talked as if Neil were his old friend he hadn’t seen in eons. If you were behind him in line, you’d swear he was counting his words. Even after we’d have to walk him past Neil so someone else could get in there, he’d still be talking back over his exposed, tank-top wearing shoulder. Still smiling. Still nice. Still happy.

Then… he’d stay. Until we left. Talking to anyone willing to talk to him… including [The Guy with the Eyes](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/the-guy-with-the-eyes) and [Al “Scooter” Rogers](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/alfred-al-rogers). Schnorring up free food.

But unlike the other 2 chronics I mentioned, we didn’t fear him, we didn’t worry about anyone’s safety. He was just chronically there before, during, and after any event.

Here’s how I remember him looking: (photo missing)

# Chronic Review - The Guy with the Eyes

Overview of WIOD chronic - The Guy with the Eyes

_by AK - July 23, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Chronic Review - The Guy with the Eyes

Tuesday Afternoon Examination: The Chronic known as “The Guy with the Eyes”.

Back when I was the “promotions flunkie”, I was the kid who’s job it was to load up the van with Neil autograph cards, sharpies, prizes, registration boxes, banners, tables, chairs, etc etc. So I’ve seen and met all of the major WIOD chronic crew. “The Guy with the Eyes” was one of them.

Here’s how I’d describe him to a police sketch artist:

Massive head. Fred Gwynn-like. With a Fred Flintstonesque hairline, and a Joe Rose-ish roundness. Sitting on a wide but short neck. Always sporting a 5 O’clock shadow. Pale blue green eyes. Greasy messy black hair peppered with grey. Tall.. probably at least 6 feet tall. Paunchy but solid build. In high school probably played football, but now in his 40’s (then) was paunchy and overweight. Wearing what appeared to be a Red Cross hand me down hand me down t-shirt from the 70’s, 3 sizes too small. Tight shorts like a gym teacher would wear.

He was so unliked, and he knew it. He wouldn’t wait in line to meet Neil; he’d just skulk around and stand behind the line waiting for Neil to acknowledge him, even if caustically.

“Can I have your autograph, Neil” a young lady would ask him after waiting in line for 40 minutes. “Sure… don’t forget to get Boy Gary’s autograph too..that’s him over there” pointing at the Guy with the Eyes. TGWTE would half smile and yell something back as the entire crowd would turn and hatefully look towards him.

Nobody ever spoke to him, other than the other oddball weirdo chronics who stood in the background with him.

Only once or twice did he ever wait or approach Neil that I saw.. and both times I and someone else from the station would stand between he and Neil. He was so creepy-homeless-psycho looking that you couldn’t take any chances.

One thing he ALWAYS did do? Go for the free food at any remote.

I don’t know how or why the animosity started.. or even why he was really called ‘The Guy with the Eyes”.. Jorge would have to tell that story.

Attached is what I remember him looking like… although the t-shirt is way too big.

Still to Come: the “Fanny Pack Guy” and Al Rogers

# Chronic Review - "The Amazing Giwbewt"

Overview of WIOD chronic Gilbert"

_by AK - July 26, 2013_

Friday Midday Story: Chronic Review - “The Amazing Giwbewt” - Waaahahaha

Part Rainman, Part Jim Ignatowski, Part “Who Knows What.” And I knew him better than most.

So this one is gonna be a long bedtime story. Sorry.

(NOTE: I will speak of him in past tense because I haven’t seen nor spoken to him in well over a decade…not because I know he died or anything)

Ok. Let’s get this out of the way first. Gilbert had been a long time chronic even before I got there. He’s been around since the invention of the pencil. And he was a part of Neil’s show long before I got to WIOD. He was a guest, and a regular caller and chronic. Somewhere along the line, either because Neil grew tired of him, or Jorge or some other producer grew tired of him, or Neil told Jorge to stop putting him on the air cuz he calls every day, or the PD said no more, or whatever, he was banned.

Because Jorge was the first line of defense, and knowing Jorge as I did, my guess was that at first, Jorge (or for that matter, whomever was the producer before him) nicely told him thanks and goodbye. But my guess is Gilbert would continue to call multiple times a day, over and over to talk to Neil, and they grew fed up with him, and just started hanging up when he called.

By the time I got there, Jorge had a pretty detailed distaste for Gilbert because he was such a pain in the ass, and for the kind of show neil was doing by then, didn’t really fit in…and because Jorge just kept hanging up on him as soon as he heard his voice, or because Jorge told him to “stop calling, don’t ever call again”, Gilbert had this deep hatred of Jorge. At some point I think Gilbert even tried to call the PD and get Jorge fired. But this is stuff Jorge would have to answer.

So ok, then I arrive at WIOD, and work promotions. And Gilbert is always there.. ALWAYS. So at every live appearance, you could count on 5 things: Neil, [The Guy with the Eyes](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/the-guy-with-the-eyes), [The Fanny Pack Guy](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/the-fanny-pack-guy), [Al Rogers](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories/alfred-al-rogers), and Gilbert.

I thought Gilbert was funny, weird, a kook. But not in any way as frightening as the other chronics. He was simply, just Gilbert.

He listened non-stop to talk radio… ALL of it. And could recite things said 30 years ago from stations that didn’t exist anymore by people who died 28 years ago. It didn’t matter that you never heard of them or that he’d lived in NY when he’d listened.. he would talk to you like you knew them. “Hey, wemembew when Fwed said dat? Wemembew?” Uh, no?

By the time I started doing producing, especially after joining Rick and Suds, I had to frequently call Gilbert at home on the phone. Rick and Suds would come up with some idea they wanted to have Gilbert in on, and I’d have to make contact. And occasionally, I’d have to leave a number to have him call me back. So Gilbert had my phone number. Sometimes it led to great stories for on the air, and great bits of info to use for future bits, but often it lead to both insane hilarity at home, or insane headaches, or insane tedium.

RING! “Hey adam, it’s Giwbewt. Wanna pawty?” Sorry Gilbert, I have some friends over right now (click speakerphone on for all to hear) “Oh yeaw? Got any giwls over thewe?” Yeah dude.. we’re partying, drinking beers, having fun “O I wike giwls and beew. I wike to pawty”

or-

RING! “I dont wike that Gowge. He’s awwayz hanging up on me. I dont know what I did, but he he shood be fiyewed. I’m gonna call Boy Gawy”

or-

RING! “Hey wemembew when Bob Grant was tawking abouwt taxi dwivews”

uh, no.

He was a HUGE Miami Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes fan. HUGE. Didn’t matter if they’d lost by 200.. he was always cheering for them, and always considered the next game to be potentially their gweatest win ever.

He drove a car (something even Al Rogers didn’t do). He’d worked in a pencil factory (something The Guy With The Eyes never learned to use). He dressed in Tshirts and sansabelt pants (which was still better fashion sense than the Fanny Pack Guy).

I don’t have any really great stories about Gilbert other than the ones I’ve previously shared here, or you’ve heard on the best of clips I’ve posted here before. Happy to re-share them again here for anyone interested.

This is what I remember him looking like: (photo missing)

# The WIOD Blimp

What happened to the WIOD Blimp?

_by AK - July 26, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > The WIOD Blimp

In 1992, the Marketing Director of WIOD, my boss when I was an intern and when I was in the Promotions Department (Kurt Steier aka “Evil Twin”) got corporate approval for a HUGE WIOD Blimp. It was gigantic as far as radio station props go; the size of a public bus, had an internal light, and took TWO FULL giant helium tanks to inflate it each time. Back then it cost about $5 Grand… which was a TON of money to spend on anything besides your employees (myself not included of course) or station vehicles.

It was his pride and joy, and nobody was allowed to use it for just any-ole event. It’s inaugural event was for Dolphins Draft Day Party in April of that year. He and I and I think one other person ( Halcyon Salazar probably) spent hours setting up for the event inside and outside.. While it inflated it took out line like a marlin… 100 yards, 200…300.. and got tied down by it’s linguini thick nylon tether. The winds and storm clouds came in, so within about 3 hours, we reeled that sucker in like we were in a Hemingway novel. We folder it up, putting each piece we’d just removed from individual boxes back where it belonged, and packed it all up. It wasn’t used again until June, for the 1992 Miami Regatta Speed Boat Races on Biscayne Bay, sponsored by 610 WIOD.

It was a spectacular June Day.. no breeze, very warm, not a cloud in the sky. And because this was a big station event we were the media partner of, Kurt had promised them, and decided for us, that we’d fly our airship out there.

Normally, one one person from promotions showed up at station event. We drove the vehicle, set up the prizes and game, handed out stuff, dressed up the table pretty with station stickers and pamphlets and other crappola. And I was that guy. It was such an awesome day, that I decided to invite out new part-time news guy who lived down the street from the station to join me.. “Come hang out dude.. I never been to a speed boat race.. it’s supposed to be packed, and it’s an awesome day. We’ll set up this stuff, hang for a while, party, and go see the races.. whattaya say?”

Dan Stewart, the newsguy was all in. “Sure man. Sounds like a good way to kill a Saturday as any other I can think of. Let’s roll”.

So he helps (mostly watches) me load up the big van with stuff, grab our passes and credentials, and we’re off.

We arrive, and I’m large and in charge. I’m telling him to do this and do that, and he’s cool about it, cuz I got him something to do today, for free, and all he’s gotta do is help out. So we set up the tent, and the table, and all the other junk, and we break out the blimp. Lovingly. Delicately. “Gotta be REALLL cool, Dan. This is the Boss’s baby. Costs a fortune. On and on. And we put the goddam thing together, and add the two tanks of helium, and let that fucker fly…

One thing that came with the blimp was the ground stake, which at Joe Robbie Stadium (That’s right… it was and will always STILL be goddam JRS to me) was easily pounded into the ground with a sledgehammer. But here, we were on asphalt. No dice with that. So we have to tie it.

Even though it’s up like 300 yards, there’s still another 30 feet worth of line on the spool, so we got PLENTY of room. Too much even, but I’m not taking any chanced. I climb on top of our rolling radio vehicle, and wrap and tie the line around the roof rail like 9 times, and toss it down to Dan to tie off the spool around the eyehook near the bumper. There. Done. We were the SHIT. People came around just following the blimp down to us and for 2 hours we clowned around with the crowd, introducing each other to people who wander over to the table as News Man Chuck Meyer, or Defo, or Sonny Hirsch or Mike Disney.

The 2 hours ends, and whattaya know… we find out our press passes get us into the beer garden.

Anyone of you guys familiar with Hunter Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? I dont mean that crappy Johnny Depp movie.. I mean actually READ it? Yeah, well, I’m Thompson, and Dan is his attorney.

Dan: “Beer garden? FUCK YEAH! We should go”

Me: “I hear Pauly Shore is here partying with the Hooters Girls”

Dan: “As your attorney I advise you that we should go drink massive amounts of beer with Pauly Shore and the Hooters Girls”

Me: “I will heed your advice, my good man. Let’s go”

And off we go. And we’re hangin with Pauly and tapping that keg like it was air and we were trapped underwater. And the Hooters girls are everywhere. And some girl taps me on the shoulder and says “You balloon is gone”

“Yea ok. Thanks for that” and I give Dan a like “What the fuck is this drunken moron talking about?” and go back to talking with Dan, and Pauly and like 6 girls who are just mesmerized by Pauly as if he was the Dali Lama. Then it hits me. OHHHHHHHH FUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKK and RUN to the van.

Off in the distance of a perfectly clear sky, off to the south i see this:

(photo missing)

That about the size of it. Headed to Cuba. What the hell could I possibly do? Nothing at all. The rope was gone too… every inch. So I’m pretty sure it wasn’t cut.. they would have had to cut it in just the right place to have it unravel all the way around what we’d tied it to.. I think what actually happened is that when I asked Dan to tie it around the eyehook, he tied it in a knot around it, not through it. And it slipped, and the pull of the wind on the blimp eventually after 2 plus hours, pulled enough until unwound all the loops and crosses around the vehicle and eventually lifted off with its umbilical.

We packed up and left. I was crushed. And scared for my job. and I didn’t even tell anyone for a while that Dan was there. It was my responsibility, so I was gonna take the fall for it. I called my boss and told him the awful news. He said we’d talk Monday. When I got there, I surprisingly didn’t get fired (I’d left off the Pauly Shore part of the story as well as Dan’s attendance) and got called in to Rick and Suds to tell the story on the air. When they asked me what did I think when I got back to the van and saw it gone, I said.. “Where’s my blimp!” They thought that way a riot… and although it was super embarrassing and scary because i was still employed by god-knows-how, having them joke about it on the air, and then have Marvin recode me saying that phrase a few different ways made me feel better about the incident.

For weeks afterward, we’d get calls from people claiming to have seen the blimp, or found it in their yard, or read that it’s been shot down over Cuba or whatever.

# This Place is a ZOO!

This Place is a ZOO!

Saturday Morning Bedtime Story

“This Place is a ZOO!”

One of the weirdest things about talk radio, including most morning shows that don’t play any music, as opposed to any other format, is “the Control Room”. While there is a control board in the studio for the host to control the volume of the various microphones and cds, and computers, punch up callers onto the air, a dump button etc, there is also a control room that often not only had the same controls for the same elements, but ALSO has controls for things like satellite feeds for other programming, controls for non-show elements like the news guy’s booth, the traffic guy’s booth, etc.

And because the guys in the control room needs to be not only able to answer the calls, and monitor every thing happening in all those other places, he’s also the last line of defense of everything going on in the studio. Therefore, there’s often a HUGE, double pane, soundproof, shatterproof glass window looking in on the other room. If the host starts waving his arms to get the Control Room’s attention, they need to see it… and vice versa. We’d wave our arms to get their attention and then use hand signals to communicate.

Holding your fists together and bending them in opposite directions means “Another Break Already”. Waving the vinyl album size pad of paper means “You have a LIVE spot to read now!”. Pointing at your eye means “look at the screen”. Putting your pointer finger to your temple with your thumb raised means the Program Director is on the hotline. But I digress.

And because there’s that HUGE glass window separating the two rooms, anyone who comes into the control room cannot only see everything going on in the studio, but the host can see everyone and everything going on in the control room.

And people would wander in there, myself included when I wasn’t running the board, to watch Uncle Neil. Hell, that’s how I started working at WIOD. I was an intern counting COAST cards just sitting in the control room watching for my first 2 months there. And it was awesome.

So because of that huge glass, it was like the “Neil Rogers” zoo in there. People would wander in to marvel at the animal on the other side of the glass. “Look at him roaring!” they’d marvel. “Ohh, he’s eating!” they’d titter. “Is he flipping us off?” they’d wonder.

People out of the blue listening in their cubicles or in their offices or in the hallways (it was piped into every corner of the building, including the engineering department, accounting, even the restrooms) would hear something about themselves being mentioned on air, or about someone else, or just something they wanted to see in person and wander in to observe. Some wandered in because they had a legitimate reason to go in there, like engineering to fix something, or the trafficking department to write on the programming log, or production to put a few more cart commercials in the racks.. and they’d inevitably stay to watch for a few minutes. And as soon as the beast beyond the glass noticed them, he salivated over the thought of grabbing by the throat verbally and eating them alive.

There’s a great example on video of this in action during the video clip of “Nobody Rips You Better”. Bald, cherub faced, cherub bodied engineer Steve Zeigler in the control room with a screwdriver to fix something, takes a seat on the counter to watch for a few. “Go pull a cord somewhere! Go DO something!” Steve holds the screwdriver to his crotch intimating pulling his cord. “Pull what? In your case a good question”. And Steve just smiles and watches, like a kid peering into the gorilla cage.

“Villa Deli is here with a huge spread of food…” roars the beast. And 15 people wander into the controlroom to watch him feast, hopeful they’ll get some scraps.

“Tom Denniberg had me go out to a client who wants me to sing at his kid’s bar mitzvah” roars the beast… and Tom wanders into the control room to watch and hear the beast gnaw on his ego.

“Boy Gary says we can’t play ‘Trouser Trout’ any more, but I’m gonna play it anyway” growls the beast while Gary stands in the control room, arms crossed, staring at the beast. “Uncross those arms and keep snapping those suspenders there. It’s about the only thing I’ve ever seen you do well”

Not everyone who wandered in there had their carcasses shredded. Sometimes the beast beyond the glass was complimentary.. or the beast was busy talking. But it didn’t matter. They came in and watched anyway.

A few paragraphs back I described being lucky enough to have been allowed the keys to the zoo by Jorge and Neil to sit in there for hours at a time as “awesome”. That’s a weak description, if I’ honest. My first introduction to radio was watching NEIL GODDAM ROGERS do his show every weekday from 10-2 at WIOD. How frickin’ lucky did I get?? I spent 4 years in high school, and 4 years in college, and the education I got from Uncle Neil in those 2 months changed me forever. One day I’m applying for an internship, and the next, I’m Jane Goodall in the African Jungle, memorized at just how human the beast really is.

# WIOD Cart Wars

How the carts worked at WIOD.

_by AK - July 17, 2013_

Did you know? There were “cart wars” at the old WIOD. The rules of engagement were that you could NOT use Neil’s carts, but Neil could use anyones and if he liked them, take them as his own and you were SOL.

Not because of some official rule; it’s just the way it worked. Neil was the godfather and if he wanted to wet his beak with some of your show’s sound effects, it was the price you paid for staying in his good favor.

Some examples: The Drew Michaels “Uh-NO!” and the “OKAY!” were both carted up for Randi after Drew had filled in for her.

# Fear and Delivering in New Orleans

The WIOD road trip to New Orleans.

_by AK - December 4, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Fear and Delivering in New Orleans

Wednesday Midday Bedtime Story: Fear and Delivering in New Orleans.

In December 1992, I was still a part time Promotions grunt and part time board operator, filling out my 16 hour days at WIOD with only 7.5 hours or less on paper to fulfill my under 29.5 hours per week as necessary to not receive overtime; I had nowhere else to go, nothing else to do, and it was more of an education than I’d received in 4 years of high school and 4 years of college. Plus, it was exciting and fun.

WIOD at that time was the long time flagship station of the University of Miami Hurricanes, with Sonny Hirsch as the play-by-play icon. I was frequently working at the games, either as the guy covered in dirt in the parking lot setting up the tailgate parties, or producing the broadcast in the rickety tin shack atop the stadium that swayed and creaked when the crowd cheered.

There are many people who loved the Orange Bowl. I’m sure for them it holds many fond memories of a lifetime ago when the Fin and Canes won championships there. But let’s be honest; that place was a goddam toilet. Besides the fact that the “pressbox” was a late add on perched onto a rafter you had to climb to get in to, the parking consisted of paying cash to the residents in one of the worst neighborhoods to park on their lawn. And what f-ing stadium forces groups of men to stand around and urinate into a trough filled with ice? WTF is THAT? But I digress…

Sonny Hirsch was a really good guy. At least to me he was. He was a BIG guy. Jewish. A total mensch. And he always greeted me the same way, with that booooming voice he’d say “Myyyy man, ADAM” and wink. And smile that huge smile of his. Remember, I’m a nobody in that place. A part time board op and part time promotions flunkie. And Sonny treated me like I’d been there forever, and we were old friends. Always. So not unlike how I’d do anything to help out Neil, or Rick and Suds, or Maddog, I would do the same for Sonny. “Hey can you grab me the sports page?” he’d ask on his way to the “Sports Office” which was really a converted closet of sorts. And I’d bring him the paper and he’d lean back in his chair with his feed on the desk next to the reel to reel machine and his microphone and ask me about what I was up to, always peppered with Yiddish.

Not everyone was that friendly and willing to treat you that way. That’s probably why I have warm memories about Sonny, and Neil et al.. while others, not so much.

So the top ranked Canes are set to take on the unctuous Alabama Crimson Tide for the National Championship in the Sugar Bowl on Jan 1st. And as the HOME of the CANES, what did the management decide to spend our company money on? TV ads announcing the game heard live on WIOD? Trips for listeners to head to New Orleans to cheer on their local team? Newspapers.

I guess the coffers were fat in those days… this would never happen in today’s economic climate.

Kurt, the Promotions and Marketing Director, had me look in to what it would take to have the Miami Herald delivered to the hotels for the Canes team and coaches, as well as the hotels where the majority of Canes Fans were staying. I researched the price for shipping, and delivery, and putting a wrap on them. I worked out all the figures. And it turned out that the price of a .25 cent newspaper would cost around $7 bucks to deliver.

So what did they decide to do instead?

Send Adam to New Orleans for 3 days, armed with cheaply printed 2 color “Courtesy of WIOD – HOME OF THE CANES” stickers, ship him the newspapers each morning at 5am, and have him go door to door delivering the newspapers to every hotel door he could.

Seriously.

I was given 1 round trip plane ticket, hotel room in the same building where the team and staff were staying for 3 days, and credentials for the game.

Prior to departing, I’d called the hotels close to where we were staying and in my official “News Radio 610 WIOD MIAMI, Home of the Miami Hurricanes” voice what the plan was, and “could they bring them to the rooms each morning, since I’m sure their security wouldn’t allow me to wander the hallways”. And they agreed.

So pretty much, the ONLY thing I had to do in New Orleans was wake up at 4:45, put stickers on 500 newspapers, and walk them in stacks of 100 to the lobby of 4 different hotels conveniently located next door and across the street. I only had to hand deliver to the doorstep the 100 in my own hotel. I was done by 6am. Back to bed for 3 hours.

Now they only gave me one plane ticket, but the hotel room was nice, and I was never told I COULDN’T bring a buddy… so I got my old college room mate, the guy who’d, interestingly enough, turned me on to Neil and Rick and Suds, to fly down. And we were OUT. OF. CONTROL. despite a winter cold front blowing through. It was in the 20’s at night, and neither of us has so much as a sweatshirt.

He and I had a system for stickering and delivering the newspapers so it took even less time. Then the rest of the day was coffee and beignets at Café Du Monde, Jacksons Brewery and godddam French Quarter. It was bedlam. The city was filled with people like it is during Marti Gras. I’d been to New Orleans a few times, but he hadn’t, so I spent a lot of time showing him around to the finer window and doorway drink distribution locations. (If you’ve ever been there, you know what I’m talking about. If not, basically every window, doorway, and actual hole in a brick wall is somewhere you can purchase a drink. You hand them cash, they hand you a beer. Or other home brewed highly alcoholic concoction.

On New Years Eve I introduced him to something handed out called a “Hurricane”. He’d never had one. It’s basically 22 different types of rum with just enough Koolade in it to change the color to red and make it sweet enough to give you instant tooth decay, in a 2 foot tall, 8 inch diameter plastic test tube. And he drank it fast.

Within 15 minutes he was stumbling over cobblestone streets and his eyes were pointing in different directions. And around his mouth between his nose and his chin was a deep red stain. He looked like a toddler after an ice pop.

In the streets, people were going berserk.. not only was it New Year’s Eve, but the game was the next day.. so roving mobs of Canes and Tide fans were drunkenly singing their team’s fight songs, and fighting.

That’s around the time someone shot the Canes mascot in the face. They didn’t KNOW he was the mascot; he wasn’t wearing the costume. He was just walking with buddies singing the UM Fite song, and blammo. Shot in the face. Luckily, it was just a flesh wound. True story. Years later, I actually became friends with the guy.

The next day, was the day of the game. So I groggily got up to sticker my papers and deliver them, by myself. Not only did my buddy have a huge headache and nausea, but he’d also contracted the flu like you wouldn’t believe.

So I spent the rest of the morning wandering around the empty streets of the French Quarter until it was time to go to the Stadium for the second part of my being in New Orleans; handing out Miami Hurricanes/WIOD chatchkies.

They’d shipped me garbage bags filled with stuff from WIOD; hand-held fans, cheapo-homemade buttons, and stickers and other assorted WIOD/CANES junk to hand out outside the Stadium. Which I did… as quickly, effortlessly, and carelessly as possible. “HERE. TAKE SOME STUFF” as I opened the garbage bag and pointed on the curb outside the building. Then I ran.

I went inside, and into the pressbox where I stood around, by myself behind Sonny Hirsch calling the game as the Canes, favorite by 8 to win, got walloped and lost the National Championship in embarrassing fashion 34-13. The place was filled with dignitaries of the NCAA, New Orleans, UM and Alabama, and National Press. At one point Sonny noticed me in the room, took off his headset, gave me that HUGE smile of his and held out his gigantic hand the size of a ham and said “Myyy man ADAM. Tough game so far, eh boichick?” Then he winked, put back on his headset, and said “Thanks for the newspaper”, then continued calling the game. I felt like a million bucks.

And despite being a Canes Alum, and disappointed in the loss, I took a certain pride out of delivering the newspapers to all those Canes fans on the morning after with a WIOD sticker plastered on the front page reading: ROLLED by TIDE, because I knew one of them was for Sonny.

# WIOD Disney Diaries

WIOD and Disney

_by AK - October 21, 2013_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > WIOD Disney Diaries

Monday Afternoon Bedtime Story – WIOD Disney Diaries

I’ve covered my experience with the live broadcast part of these shows in a previous bed time story.

This one isn’t about Neil, or Rick and Suds, or Randi or Phil. This one is about the Producers, promotions staff, and the rest of us WIOD flunkies who were let loose on Disney World one long weekend.

The way these remote broadcasts go down is like this: The Client, Disney, is celebrating some big deal and wants to have the whole station head up there and broadcast their shows live from the parks in their studios on Park grounds. So the station, in addition to charging them a small fortune, insists that they’ll need to pay for all the hosts, and their spouses, and their kids attend, as well as each show’s producer, the promotions team, engineers, middle management, program directors, and Sales staff. Disney: “Okay”.

And in return, the entire station does their broadcast live from the studios in the park, interviewing their marketing director about the opening of the new ride, their President about what’s planned for later this year, local celebrities who are on site to promote their own Disney related products and shows, etc etc. And between all that, they’ll talk to a few callers on the phone and deal with echo in the headphones, and talk back to the studio to play a sound effect or bit because they cant bring that stuff with them to the park, all while trying to keep it very clean and “disneyesque”.

Say what you want about Disney… they’re no Mickey Mouse operation. Nothing happens in that park that’s unplanned.

Except when WIOD Producers show up.

The plan was we all truck up there on Wednesday night, separately. Each show does their normal shift on Thurs and Fri. We get to stay the weekend and check out Sunday.

And aside from the shows, and a few meetings with Disney representatives, we were on our own for the most part, with free world passes, transportation and food.

Thursday morning we arrive and are immediately meeting with the Disney marketing Reps who hand us all our tickets, passes, and goodies, including a huge bag containing Disney pins and an empty Photo Album marking their 20th Anniversary. Remember those commercials? “ONE….TWO….THRE, FOUR, FIVESIXSEVENEIGHTNINETENELEVEN…”

[Walt Disney World 20th Anniversary TV Commercial #2](https://youtu.be/21XMvj1v5TM)

So we finish out meeting, scarf down our free top notch lunch they provided and head off to our hotels.

The air staff, sales staff, and managers all stay in one of the big luxury places.

The riff-raff like me and the rest of the producers and promo staff get a middle level hotel, rooming all next to each other at Port Orleans.

And it’s like straight out of a college co-ed movie from the minute we check in.

We’re SOOOO loud in the lobby. Half of us are already baked from the drive over from the lunch meeting, the other half are in the bag having already been to the bar. We’re falling over each other’s luggage, some of us are just using just trash bags. We’ve got beepers going off, loudly reciting inappropriate Neil drops (“Rectum! Damn near Killed him! OHH!”), asking the Concierge where we can buy smokes and booze, and too jazzed up about 4 free days in the Magic Kingdom to pay attention to the reservations desk telling us where our rooms are located.

We dump our stuff in the rooms, grab our gear, and head to the park. MGM (Now Disney Hollywood Studios) had a real radio station just inside the main entrance, and we’re broadcasting from there.

Each show does their normal gig, and out side of that, we’re free to do whatever we want.

Most of us wander close by where we need to be, hanging out at MGM before our shifts for a few hours, taking in a ride or 3, before heading to the studios for the show. After each show, those working it head back to Port Orleans until we’re all there, all shows done for the day, and we get ready.

We sat in each other’s rooms smoking and drinking.. and then hit the park. We were a mob of like 8 or so.. 9 guys and gals all in their 20s, all on a paid, no holds barred party vacation in the Magic Kingdom.

“EPCOT FIRST!” someone says. I second the motion with “There’s BOOZE there”. And off we go.

Backpacks in hand for a change of clothes, disposable cameras, pockets stuffed with free tickets and wristbands.

We all get on the old BALL ride narrated by Walter Kronkite, where they slowly go over the history of human communication, in cars 2x2. And we’re yelling back at our group behind and out to the ones up ahead of us. As each of our cars pass the “radio” area with Marconi each yells out “OHHH!!!” . It sounded like an echo as each of our cars passed it. “OHHH!” OHHH!” OHHHH!” Cars in front of our group and craning their necks to see who’s behind us… the ones behind us are avoiding eye contact when we turn around after they “shhhhh” us.

Off that ride and straight to England to drink some beer. Then off to Mexico for the the slow boat ride and dinner (con cerveza y margaritas!) Off to Body Wars, pausing in the darkness to party in secrecy. Fireworks. France and Italy for Deserts. More pausing in darkness. Back to England.

Even after the park closed, we continued the party. A group of us gathered in Halcyon and her friend Chastine’s room, drinking, clowning around, flirting. Some stumbled home (a few doors down on the floor) and others fell asleep in their clothes on the floor or in beds.

The next morning was a train wreck. Everyone waking in a fog in their strange hotel room. Some waking in a fog in someone else’s hotel room. Struggling to get dressed to go get coffee and breakfast, then back to the park for work.

When Friday ended, there was no reason to hold back any longer. We didn’t care if we saw our bosses, the hosts with spouses or kids, managers.. We went home showered, and went straight to Pleasure Island, which was only a few years old at that time, so the novelty of it was new, and amazing, and insane. We went club to club, celebrating New Years Eve. We pretended to be a group of tourists from Oklahoma. We pretended to be a family. We pretended to be college students. We just didn’t care.

At some point, one of us referenced the 20th Anniversary.. and that commercial that ran, showing 20 fun reasons to go to Disney. And an idea and theme to our madness was created… like Frankenstein’s monster.

“Let’s create our OWN 20 reasons, take pictures, and fill up that huge photo album they gave us!”

Resounding “YES”’s by all solidified it. And for the next 2 nights and two days, we ransacked the park, pestering patrons, ticket takers, maintenance guys, even characters into performing tricks so we could get them all done.

And everywhere we went skipping, stumbling, smoking, stuporing we sang at the top of our lungs, the song.

“ONE.dadadadadada TWO..dadadadadada THREE..dadaFOUR..dada FIVESIXSEVENEIGHTNINETENELEVEN. TWELVE..dadadadadadTHIRTEEN….”

“Huey Dewey and Louie! Hold up ONE FINGER!!! “

“THREE!!!!” we all yell in unison.. “dadadadad ..FOUR.dadadadaFIVESIXSEVENEAIGHTNINETENELEVEN” and go on our way.

Photo bombing (long before that was an actual word) families who’ve waited their entire lives and saved for years to go had us holding up fingers in front of their picture at the castle.

5 Shots of rum on the counter for us “FIVESIXSEVENEIGHTNINETENELEVEN”

“Hey! Let’s get 10 girls from the Norway Ride in Epcot and use them and their boobs for 20” – “DONE! LETS GO!” and we’d grab our passes, take the tram and go get our picture with them and their boobs.

It was possibly the most drunken, out of control, Disney Themed scavenger hunt ever.

At one point, someone had lost their ticket, and we actually scammed our way in, handing our scanable park ticket back thru the fence to them so we could all be inside when we took the picture.

Finally, down to only the number “ONE” late Sunday afternoon, seated for lunch, we couldn’t figure out or agree what should cap off this incredible memorable adventure. We only had another 2 hours or so before we had to start the drive back home.. and we were at a total stand still. Marvin suggested just a picture of the photo album. Some people liked that idea. Not bad. Someone suggested just a rolled joint. Some people liked that one too… Not bad.

That’s when our waiter, the most flamboyant, lisping, tip-toeing, gay guy popped over to the table and squealed “Hey, y’all! Ith there anything I can geth you to duhhhh-RINK?”

Done. We explained who were were, probably for the first time telling the truth, and what were were doing, and about our scavenger hunt, and the radio station, and partying.

And Andy, our very gay waiter, posed holding up a big number one, smiling from ear to rear.

# Worst. Hunger Strike. EVER.

The Rick and Suds Show brings food to a hunger strike.

_by AK - December 23, 2014_

[Home](https://neilrogers.org/) > [Docs](https://neilrogers.org/docs) > [Radio Stories](https://neilrogers.org/docs/radio-stories) > Worst. Hunger Strike. EVER.

Eve of Christmas Eve Bedtime Story: Worst. Hunger Strike. EVER.

As soon as the Clinton Administration came up with that whole “wet foot – dry foot” thing to determine whether or not Cuban rafters would be sent back or not, a group of people started protesting it. It was very peaceful

A hunger strike. In front of the Miami Herald building. Why there? Because that’s where El Nuevo Herald is published probably.

So after a few days of spotty reports on WIOD and local TV stations as an aside mention during their coverage of the bigger news portion of it, Rick has a great idea.

The morning show edition of Rick Riley and Suds Coleman were very into servicing the commuter community. Lets face it.. going to work in the morning is the least “oh I have a few minutes to screw around” time of day.. People didn’t answer randomly ringing payphones… they didn’t have time to put their phone in a microwave while we listened.. they didn’t have time to call. All they did was listen as they got ready for work or drive to the office staring hard and drinking coffee. So we went where they were.. out in the streets. Providing newspapers and donuts for free at street corners. But I digress…

So Rick says he wants to host a big Cuban breakfast on a streetcorner in honor of the hunger strikers. Where? On the corner where the Herald is. Right in front of the “protesters”.

Oh boy. Here we go.

So I go into the coffee shop on Miami Beach that I’d frequented a few times… It was straight out of Seattle in there… 1995 remember? No starbucks. No free wifi. Just chess sets and old paperback books on shelves. Just Bob Marley drawings on the walls, exposed pipes in the ceiling, exposed bricks… and coffee and more coffee and some pastries. And I ask the white guy with dreadlocks, a flannel shirt and a goatee behind the counter if he’d be willing to exchange a few huge cauldrons of Cuban coffee, American coffee, trays of Cuban sandwiches and pastelitos and deliver them at 7am in front of the Miami Herald building in exchange to a few promotional mentions on the air.. and he agreed. Shaaah!

So the next morning I get up at my normal time of 4am, drive to the station, do all the daily show prep of highlighting news stories and stuff from the internet, highlighting live spots on the log, grab my associate producer of the day (a guy affectionately known as “The Reaper” because he was like 6’7 and dressed like Axl Rose.) and load up the WIOD van with four 8 foot tables, chairs, etc.

We get there at 6:30, and I’m talking to Rick and Suds on air via cellphone, setting up tables and stuff..

“What’s goin’ on down there, Adam?”

“Nothing. 3 dudes sitting on the street in lawn chairs and a guy in a sleeping bag”

“That’s it? Anything else going on?”

“Nope. Just setting up tables getting ready to set out the food.”

“What kind of tables? Like folding ones or fancy ones?”

“8 foot folding, with white linen”

“We’re all class” says Suds.

The food arrives and so do a few listeners.

Contrasts the 4 guys barely awake, needing a shave, in rumpled clothes they slept in.. with the 3 gringos in faded Guy Harvey type tshirts, worn and pitted with old baseball caps faded pastel by the sun. A few more hunger strikers showed up out of the blue and sat down on the curb.

We put out this HUGE spread.. 2 trays of Cuban sammys.. two trays of assorted pastelitos , two huge containers of coffee… napkins, plates, coffee cups, and me and Reaper and the 3 gringo scarfed. I’m on the phone with Rick and Suds schlurping Cuban coffee, and stuffing pastries in my skull…

“Tell them they’re welcome to eat.”

“Mmpf You guysmph wanna eat sumphthin’? They shake their heads no.

“Its time for breakfast! Show them how good it is”

“Mph’ts really good. Mmmmmm” holding it under their noses. “They..(gulp) say they don’t want any. “

“Ask them if they’re hungry and how long it’s been since they ate..”

“Are you hungry? When was the last time you had anything to eat?” switching to reporter mode.

The hunger striker stands up from his lawn chair and says “Yeah about last night at 6”

I laugh. “He says dinner last night”

Suds cackles.

Rick cant believe it. “Let me talk to him..”

“Ok.. Hey Pedro… “

“His name is Pedro?”

“Oh, I dunno.. that’s what I’m calling everyone here. Sorry. Hey Pedro.. here… talk to Rick N. Suds on WIOD RADIO.” And I hand the phone to him. This is what I hear…

“Yes. Yes. Ha. Yeah. Well, im leaving now to go shower and go to work. Last night at 8. Yeah. Shifts. Ok. Here” and hands me back the phone.

And that was it.. sporadically a few listeners would trickle in, grab a sandwich and coffee and split.. Reaper and I ate, the protesters had their shift change, and ate nor drank nothing. We packed up at 10am and drove back to the station.

A few days later I was sent a photo copy of the Front Page of the Wall Street Journal. There was an article above the fold about the Cuban reaction in Miami. And in one paragraph, was a mention of WIOD stopping by with food.

# WIOD Van Troubles?

Adventures with the WIOD van.

_by AK - July 18, 2013_

Ok.. since I owe people a story, here’s another…

Please keep in mind… Jorge has WAYYYY more Neil stories than I could possibly have. I worked in the building… with Randi, and Chris Baker, and Rick&Suds.. and the garden guy and Defo and Maddog and others part time.. I saw Neil every weekday between Aug 91 and the day he left the station and went to QAM… and wandered into the studio and talked with him during breaks and handled his remotes when I was in promotions. But I don’t have the nitty-gritty down-and-dirty stuff that’s probably really good reading and way more interesting…

any-who..

So this was one of my proudest moments as a producer.. One Monday, I come in around 10 or 11am, and I walk into the control room to say howdy to my bud Jorge..”Sup dooood”… And Neil is ranting about something to do with the station and the programming, and the sales department ba-ba-ba-ba, sees me, and punctuates the rant with something like “And letting that goddam Chris Baker drive around in the god dam van on Friday night”.

I just smiled ear to rear.

See, first of all, I know either Neil had a spy report about the Friday show with Baker (whom I was producing since the night Randi quit…which FYI, if you’re keeping score was the night of the OJ Bronco Chase… that’s right… while all that craziness was happening, we had Best of Randi Rhodes talking to the kid who plays the violin in Tampa and a whole bunch of mouth breathers who wanted Randi to talk dirty to them while she played queef noises).. or… Neil was listening and heard it.

I just happily shivered and laughed all over inside…just smiling.

What I knew, that apparently Neil hadn’t, was that every Friday night Chris Baker left the station.. usually in the van, (once from a boat at the Isle of Dreams), and went somewhere, broadcasting from wherever we went. One Friday we went to a comedy club while Chris got on stage and 2 girls near the broadcast booth talked so loudly you could hardly make out his act… or to a bar to play pool with people, or on that one occasion a boat into the bay. It didn’t matter much what we did.. but it was just something to pass the time, and it was different. It always started the same way.. the first half hour we talked about where we should go, decided, got the wireless mic, and the van with the big antenna, and went. Yeah, it crackled and spitted static most of the trip… but it was just something to do.

That past Friday night, the van broke down on the side of the road with a flat, and Chris had to change the tire while on the air, but the spare was too flat to drive on, and we spent the whole rest of the time on the air trying to figure out where we were, taking calls, and how the engineers could pick us up as cars and trucks wizzed by and honked.

So why was I laughing?

Because NONE of it was real. It was all done with sound effects on carts. An endless loop of static and crackling. The sound of a van door opening, shutting, vehicle starting, running, driving. The sound of a flat tire blowout, tire flapping. Traffic zooming by and honking. All fake. Even my going on the air as the poor, exasperated producer stuck in the control room giving Chris the names of the callers waiting on the line and yelling the keep the 2 girls talking over his stand-up routine. All fake.

During the break, after Neil’s rant, I walked into the studio, and told Neil it wasn’t real…none of it. We never left the studio. He just stared at me, blinking. I think he’d bought into it too. He didn’t nod. He didn’t smile. He just looked at me, still holding his mic in his hand, elbow resting on his pupik. As I finished my story, the spots ended and the rejoin began and without missing a beat as the music ended (“double you eye ohhh DEEEEEE”) he popped on his mic, swiveled in his chair and said “Adam says Chris baker’s a liar… Sunrise.. Hello…” and that was it. He didn’t mention it again or ever talk about the Friday shows again.

3 weeks later, on Chris’s Saturday show, without any of the carts or production or any of that stuff, he decided to announce a fake news story that thousands of Cubans were washing ashore in Tampa… I wasn’t there, but apparently panic happened, the batline rang, people rushed into the studio and Chris got in trouble for starting a “War of the Worlds” type panic, and we were banned from any more Friday Night trips since we were already on the Justice Department’s radar or some crapola like that.

That’s how I remember it anyway.

Tracing the decline of the once-influential medium through one of its most unique talents

2007. My mom and I were winding across a back road north of Schenectady heading home for Christmas. It was late at night and we were listening to WGY, “the Capital Region’s Breaking News, Traffic and Weather Station.” The host was interviewing a high school history teacher who was recently suspended. The teacher explained that he was giving a lesson about the upcoming Iowa caucus, but his students kept laughing every time the fateful word “caucus” came out of his mouth. The teacher then said, “So I pulled down my pants...”

“You what?” the host interjected.

“I pulled down my pants and pointed and said ‘Is this what you think is so funny?’”

My mom and I burst into hysterics. We knew the inside joke.

The host was Phil Hendrie, whose career mirrored the rise and fall of talk radio itself. For over 20 years, Hendrie hosted what seemed to be, on the surface, an ordinary talk show. He interviewed outlandish guests who said or did ridiculous things, such as a black pastor demanding that homeless people perform stunts in order to receive food from his soup kitchen, or a suburban housewife upset that her son was using porn—not because of the porn itself, but because he exclusively preferred porn featuring black women. Hendrie would then take callers, who would predictably lambast the guests for being terrible people. The guests would argue back, and Hendrie would play referee. One memorable exchange involved an upset teenage girl who was told by Hendrie’s guest to use Clearasil pads; she snapped back, “I use tampons!” The guest then howled, “Oh my God! Clearasil is for acne! I’m telling her to wash her face and she wants to stick them up her—” Many interviews would end with Hendrie hanging up on his guest in exasperation and apologizing to the caller.

There was just one catch: none of the guests were real. Every single one of them was performed by Hendrie himself, switching between his regular mic and a phone in which he would do his fake character voice. Sometimes he’d add sound effects in the background to make it seem like his “guest” was calling in from a restaurant kitchen or another location. ([A 2005 Atlantic piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/) by David Foster Wallace inaccurately claimed that Hendrie used “mike [sic] processing” in his show, befitting Wallace’s usual slipshod approach to everything.)

Hendrie was open about his game, referring to his show as “theater of the mind,” and his regular listeners were in on it. The callers weren’t. The Phil Hendrie Show was an extended, cruel prank on the concerned citizens of America. It was also funny as hell.

I was one of a handful of millennials who listened to AM radio. I’m not sure how that happened. Plenty of kids had to put up with Mom or Dad blaring Rush Limbaugh while picking up them up from school, but few actually paid attention. That said, Rush didn’t interest me. I liked Michael Savage rambling about spaghetti recipes, Rammstein, and growing up in Queens in the 50’s; I liked Art Bell talking about UFOs and Area 51; I even liked Steve LeVeille going on about shepherd’s pie and reading off the Massachusetts lotto numbers. But in my teenage years, whenever I got off my horrible second-shift Kmart job, it was Phil Hendrie twisting my diaphragm into knots of laughter on the drive home.

There was a time when talk radio mattered, when faceless voices emanating from your car stereo could make or break public figures. Even before talk radio emerged as an institution, disc jockeys wielded enormous power; the infamous “ [Disco Demolition Night](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102130812/http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History%26Glory/DiscoDemolition.htm)” in 1979, led by Chicago shock jock Steve Dahl, resulted in a full-scale riot and was partially credited with the death of the genre. “Payola” laws passed by the federal government in the 1950’s curbed the practice of record labels paying DJs and stations for song airtime, which gave unfair sales boosts to some musicians.

Talk radio itself was a relatively late innovation driven by FCC rules changes, technological innovations, and changing audience tastes. While opinionated talk hosts have been around as long as radio itself has existed, all-talk stations didn’t begin emerging until the late 1980’s, driven by the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine by the Reagan administration in 1987. The Fairness Doctrine was an FCC policy that required broadcast stations to present controversial issues from both a liberal and conservative perspective. The Democratic Party frequently used the Fairness Doctrine to challenge radio stations whose hosts were critical of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson by forcing them to air rebuttals, while Reagan White House officials feared that the doctrine’s abolition would prevent them from doing the same to the Big Three TV networks, many of whom were opposed to Reagan’s policies. The end of the Fairness Doctrine made it easier for stations to hire radio hosts based purely on their ratings and revenue potential, since they were no longer required to balance one host’s viewpoints with another host who may not have been as popular.

Another factor that spurred the growth of talk radio was the increasing popularity of FM radio. FM’s greater audio clarity meant that it was better for music-based formats, leaving lower-fidelity AM stations in the dust. AM stations began switching to all-talk based formats, since the human voice was just as audible on the AM band as it was on FM. It was in 1988 that Rush Limbaugh, who would remain the number one talk host in the U.S. until his death in 2021, entered national syndication, convincing numerous networks and station operators that talk radio formats were commercially viable.

AM radio had one technological advantage over FM radio that made it additionally suited for talk-based formats: broadcast range. Due to skywave propagation, AM signals travel further using less power, particularly over water and at night. So-called “clear channel” stations such as WABC in New York City and the aforementioned WGY, broadcasting at the FCC’s maximum allowed power of 50,000 watts, can be heard across much of North America when the sun goes down. Driving around upstate New York at night, I’ve picked up clear channel stations as far away as Chicago and Minneapolis, and I’ve tuned into WABC as far south as Virginia Beach.

Phil Hendrie’s radio show is now ancient history. If you were born after the year 1990 and have heard his name at all, it’s likely from his role as Principal Vagina on Rick and Morty, as well as various other minor roles in other shows. But for a good portion of his life, for five days a week, The Phil Hendrie Show was his bread and butter, his public joke on the world.

Hendrie’s show thrived by exploiting one of the dirty secrets of the radio industry: there’s a big difference between talk radio listeners and talk radio callers.

Conservative talk radio—let's stop pretending there's any other kind—rests on the myth that it’s an agora of well-informed intellectuals. How many times have Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, or other halfwit syndicated and local hosts promoted their shows as giving a voice to da peeple? Talk radio shows—not all, but many—are promoted as forums where intelligent people debate issues and air their views, exercises in democracy where anyone can have a say. They're nothing like the liberal media, those elitists.

The reality is that the average talk radio caller is a crank who calls into shows because they have nothing better to do. They likely don't have a job; what, do you think anyone who works for a living could sit on hold for Rush Limbaugh’s call screener for two plus hours in the middle of the workday? They have no social life and think the hosts are their friends. They’re ill-informed and would have difficulty reading a restaurant menu. They half-listen to what they hear, get outraged, and dial up because they just have to ejaculate their opinions into someone else’s ears. The industry refers to talk radio callers as “chronics,” which should give you an idea of what little regard they have for the poor saps.

I knew a likely “chronic” once, when I lived in Chicago. He was my next door neighbor. He was on disability, listened to Michael Savage, and would leave his door open while listening to the radio or watching TV in the hopes somebody would stop in and talk to him. He would constantly rant about “GOD DAMN COMMUNISTS” and how the Democrats were “KILLING BABIES!” whenever he watched the evening news. He also had a fondness for loudly masturbating on the toilet with the window open and once threw his DVD player out the window while drunk. It landed on the roof of the bungalow next door.

One time, he drunkenly pulled me into his apartment and offered to share his marijuana tea with me while also rambling about how he had bought a smartphone and used it to search for “pretty pink pussies,” but the “lesbian prostitute” who lived one floor down had stolen the phone. He also once woke me up one morning walking past in the hallway loudly talking about how he had been trying to impress some black girl by buying her stuff from Target, but she still wouldn’t fuck him, so he hired two hookers to go down on him. I came back from a trip to Nashville one weekend and found an eviction notice from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office taped to his front door. I never saw him again.

This isn't the only example of the phoniness that radio operates on; for example, FM morning zoo radio contests are generally dominated by a handful of “ [contest pigs](https://www.vulture.com/2015/05/a-short-history-of-opie-anthonys-jocktober.html)” and nobody else cares. Hendrie’s genius was recognizing that the average talk radio caller was like my neighbor—a crazed, delusional freak with too much free time—and running with it. The frisson of his show was not the humor of his fake guests, but the callers who got alternately bludgeoned and comforted by Hendrie in his different voices, not knowing they were the victims of a scam. While Hendrie was occasionally accused of faking his callers, most prominently by crosstown competitor Tom Leykis—with whom he had a long-running feud—anyone with a tiny bit of insider knowledge of radio knew that Hendrie’s callers were too stupid to be scripted.

Talk radio may have gotten its start as an independent medium in the late 80’s, but it wouldn’t hit its stride until the 90’s.

By the middle of the decade, many radio hosts were well-established as influential figures in the political sphere. Rush Limbaugh’s jeremiads against Bill Clinton were partially credited with the Republican Revolution of 1994. Bob Grant, a fixture of local NYC talk who Howard Stern called “the greatest broadcaster that has ever lived,” was a major influence on the victories of Republicans Rudy Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral race, [Christine Todd Whitman](https://rightfrequency.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/frank-lautenberg-vs-bob-grant-in-political-dog-fight/) in the 1993 New Jersey gubernatorial race, and [George Pataki](https://web.archive.org/web/20180228163147/https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/bob-grant-tip-no-sermons-mario-article-1.687686) in the 1994 New York gubernatorial race. Stern himself, after aborting his run for governor on the Libertarian ticket, endorsed Pataki, who in turn enacted the “Howard Stern Bill” in 1995: a bill restricting road workers in the NYC and Long Island areas to only working at night.

The overwhelmingly right-wing bent of AM talk didn’t escape scrutiny, with journalists and politicians accusing Limbaugh and his imitators of coarsening public discourse and causing polarization, as Republican politicians became more extreme out of fear of being denounced by radio hosts. Many urged the government to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine, arguing that the promotion of conservative talkers was influenced by runaway corporate dominance of the media. This did not happen. Instead, Clinton went in the opposite direction with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which opened the floodgates.

Longstanding FCC rules limited companies to owning two AM stations and two FM stations per media market, as well as 40 stations in total. The 1996 act increased the individual media market cap to eight stations, as well as [eliminating the overall cap](https://web.archive.org/web/20160211025344/https://thehill.com/policy/technology/268459-bill-clintons-telecom-law-twenty-years-later/). This set off a feeding frenzy among media corporations as they began buying up every radio station they could find, then merging and gobbling each other up like the slimes in Ultima. The economy was doing great then. Surely those stations would keep making money forever.

Keeping track of the corporate consolidations and so on during this period is like trying to map out the love triangles in a telenovela, and equally pointless. All you really need to know is that despite the proponents of the 1996 act claiming it would foster competition, by 2001, the number of individual radio station owners in the U.S. [had dropped from 5,100 to 3,800](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304192130/http://blog.a3cfestival.com/how-the-telecom-act-of-1996-impacted-hip-hop). By 2005, the number of major media companies had been reduced to only six.

Like many talk radio hosts, Phil Hendrie got his start as a DJ, working at the suburban Orlando station of WBJW in 1973 at the age of 20. He would hold a succession of radio jobs in New Orleans, Miami, San Diego, and other cities before getting a weekend talk show on KFI in his native Los Angeles in 1989.

A year later, he would move to KVEN in Ventura, California, where he struck gold. With the Gulf War in the news, Hendrie created a fake character, an Iraqi named Raj Fahneen, who defended Saddam Hussein. Callers poured in to angrily argue with “Fahneen,” and Hendrie realized he had a hit on his hands. He began creating more characters, such as Jay Santos, the self-appointed neighborhood watchman; Doug Dannger, an Orange County gossip columnist who incessantly reminds everyone that he is “a gay man and a gay journalist”; Ted Bell, the arrogant owner of the Ted’s of Beverly Hills steakhouse with its cheery tagline, “Here at Ted’s, we'd love to put our meat in your mouth.”

After stints in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Miami, Hendrie would return to LA in 1996 to host his show on KFI, the top-rated talk station in the city. Three years of ratings success later, his show was picked up for national syndication by Premiere Radio Networks, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), the largest owner of radio stations in America and responsible for syndicating Rush Limbaugh's program. It also greatly expanded the number of unwitting victims who’d call in.

At its apogee, The Phil Hendrie Show had over a million weekly listeners and was carried on over 100 radio stations across the country, such as WSYR in my hometown of Syracuse and WGY in nearby Albany. This is all the more remarkable given the timeslot in which it aired: 10PM-1AM Eastern (7-10PM Pacific), well outside of peak listening hours. At the same time, Hendrie began to pursue an acting career, appearing in several episodes of Futurama, an episode of Andy Richter Controls the Universe, and the film Team America: World Police. In 2006, he landed a starring role in NBC’s Teachers, a sitcom from one of the creators of Scrubs that was unfortunately cancelled after its first season.

In the early 2000’s, the first signs of trouble were on the horizon for the radio industry.

Most stations and companies were still profitable. The economy was still doing well, ensconced in the post-9/11 bubble of delusion. But unlike in the 90’s, radio no longer had a captive audience. New competitors were emerging. And radio completely miscalculated and responded to the wrong competitor.

The early oughts saw the emergence of satellite radio, which traditional radio firms mistakenly saw as their primary threat. This fear was amplified when Howard Stern decamped to Sirius Satellite Radio in 2006, citing longtime frustrations with management following indecency crackdowns in the wake of Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl “wardrobe malfunction” in 2004. Opie and Anthony, another popular NYC shock jock act, also moved to XM Satellite Radio in 2004 following their firing from WNEW over the “Sex for Sam” contest, in which they encouraged a couple to hook up in a vestibule in a church.

Another problem for talk radio was demographics. The most coveted advertising demographic for talk radio stations was the 25-54 age range. But by the turn of the century, the Limbaugh audience was getting AARP cards and Viagra scripts. A long-term crisis was around the corner.

Radio responded in the way you’d imagine corporate suits who think purely in numbers would. One ill-fated maneuver was launched by CBS Radio with its “Free FM” stations. The branding was simple: FM radio was free, satellite radio cost money. Capische? These stations featured more youth-oriented “hot talk” hosts of the Howard Stern variety, such as Adam Carolla, Tom Leykis, and Opie and Anthony (airing a censored version of their XM show).

An even dumber solution was “HD radio.” FM and AM stations spent thousands on upgrading their transmitters for marginally better audio fidelity. HD-FM stations were also capable of broadcasting secondary stations on the same bandwidth, similar to digital over-the-air TV stations. The only problem is that you needed a special HD radio to receive these superior signals. HD radios ranged from $50 for cheapo models to hundreds of dollars. Most listeners were unwilling to spend this amount of money to replace their car stereos and alarm clocks. The only thing that would have made them do it is a law forcing them to, akin to the digital TV changeover that occurred in 2009. Nobody cared enough to force a similar law for radio through Congress, so HD radio withered on the vine.

HD-AM radio technology was also flawed on a technical level. Many HD-AM stations had a habit of blasting static across adjacent frequencies, a major problem for any station that happened to broadcast there. In the late 2000’s, Bob Savage, the owner of talk radio station WYSL in Rochester, New York, [filed an FCC complaint against Boston-based clear channel station WBZ](https://www.fybush.com/NERW/2007/071105/nerw.html), alleging that interference from WBZ’s HD signal was making WYSL, located on the adjacent 1040 frequency, unlistenable within its broadcast range.

A final, desperate maneuver from many talk radio stations was moving to the FM band. While I already mentioned that CBS Radio tried to compete with Stern with their “Free FM” stations, many long-running traditional talk stations began transferring their formats to FM wholesale, under the thinking that younger listeners had abandoned the AM band entirely. KIRO in Seattle was one of the first to migrate to FM, making the move in 2008 and turning its former AM clear channel frequency into an all-sports station, while other stations such as WGY stuck to simulcasting their programming on FM.

Worth mentioning during this time is the formation of Air America Radio, an explicitly progressive talk radio network designed to compete with the traditionally right-wing industry. Launched in 2004, Air America initially featured programs hosted by prominent celebrities such as Al Franken, Janeane Garofalo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Arianna Huffington, as well as some actual radio hosts such as Randi Rhodes and Rachel Maddow. However, the network never took off due to the inexperience of many of its key hosts (whose talents didn’t translate to the radio realm), incompetent management, and its insistence on a network-based distribution format as opposed to the more common syndication model, which inhibited its growth by restricting only one station per media market from carrying its programs. By 2006, Air America had filed for bankruptcy; after being purchased by new buyers the following year, it would attempt to retool by hiring experienced hosts such as Ron Kuby, Lionel, and the Young Turks. This was not enough, and the Great Recession would end Air America for good in 2010.

## ***

In April of 2006, [Phil Hendrie announced that he was retiring from radio](https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2006/04/28/Phil-Hendrie-retiring-from-radio/41331146262372/). After over three decades on the air, he was moving on.

His stated reason was to focus on his acting career. While it had recently been announced that Teachers would not be renewed for another season, Hendrie had other projects going on at the time and believed he had taken his show as far as it could go. However, any longtime listener could read between the lines. Hendrie was frustrated with Premiere for the same reasons that had driven Stern away from terrestrial radio. Following the Janet Jackson incident, Hendrie’s show had been increasingly censored by management; for example, the infamous Ted’s of Beverly Hills ad now had to have the word “mouth” bleeped out. In 2005, his show had also been moved from number one-rated KFI to the less-popular KLAC, a sports talk station; his replacement on KFI was John Ziegler, the generic conservative talker that David Foster Wallace profiled in his Atlantic piece.

However, in the months leading up to his retirement announcement, Hendrie had increasingly dedicated shorter segments on his program to lamenting the sorry state of corporate radio. Hendrie had always been an odd duck in the talk radio world beyond the nature of his program. For one, he was an ardent liberal and registered Democrat in an industry dominated by the right-wing. While he had a dim view of the average talk radio caller due to how easily he was able to fool so many of them, he believed in radio as an art form and felt it could be so much more than what it was: hundreds of Rush Limbaugh clones spouting the same “Republicans rule, Democrats drool” talking points. He often ridiculed Z-grade syndicated talkers like Rusty Humphries for being unable to think for themselves or take the medium beyond what better hosts like Limbaugh or Stern had done. Hendrie also frequently took aim at Tom Leykis, viciously mocking him as “Combover Boy,” a washed-up, morbidly obese shock jock handing out advice on how to get laid without a shred of self-awareness.

I don’t know if Hendrie had some insider knowledge that radio was headed for a fall, he had a gut feeling that bad things were around the bend, or he was just tired of the whole thing. But regardless, on June 23, 2006, The Phil Hendrie Show ended its decade-long run. Hendrie would retain his website and “Backstage Pass” subscription plan for fans to access his large archive of past shows, but his radio career was over.

_Read [Part 1 here](https://neilrogers.org/docs/voices-p1/)_

The radio stations that Clear Channel, Citadel Broadcasting, and other corporate behemoths had snapped up in the wake of 90’s deregulation were bombs in disguise. It was in late 2006 when they started going off.

The real competitor to your local FM or AM station was not satellite radio. It was the Internet. The online realm opened up a world of entertainment to the average consumer, most of which was completely free, and the universal adoption of broadband and WiFi in the mid-2000’s sped this along. There was simply no way radio could compete.

The strong economy of the 90’s and early 2000’s masked radio’s structural problems, such as its aforementioned aging demographics or the fact that media conglomerates had overleveraged themselves, purchasing radio stations left and right with no plan for long-term profitability. When the housing bubble began to leak air in the final years of Dubya’s presidency, the radio industry’s flu morphed into full-on tuberculosis. Clear Channel and all the rest were suddenly hemorrhaging money with no end in sight and banks unwilling to extend them any credit.

The response was pure bean counter thinking: fire the people at the bottom.

Across America, local radio hosts and DJs were laid off in waves. Talk show hosts were replaced with syndicated programming; DJs were replaced with auto-tracking. Smaller market stations had their staffs consolidated, so that the voice you heard on your local station was often coming from hundreds of miles away. News departments were cut to the bone, traffic and weather outsourced.

A fine example of how this ruined local stations can be seen in what happened to WSYR, the main news/talk station in my hometown of Syracuse. Up until 2006, WSYR had its own full-time news department that provided live updates 22 hours per day, 7 days a week. It had in-house traffic (along with a traffic copter), weather provided by a local, co-owned TV station, and local morning and afternoon hosts, along with a noon news program. Following a wave of Clear Channel budget cuts, half of the news staff was fired, cutting live news to 14 hours per day on weekdays only. The noon news program was cancelled and the afternoon host had his program lengthened by an hour with no increase in his salary. Weather was outsourced to the Weather Channel. The traffic departments of news/talk stations WGY and WHAM in Rochester (also owned by Clear Channel) were fired, with the WSYR traffic staff expected to file traffic updates for those stations (again, with no increase in their salaries). The traffic copter was retired.

In Pearl S. Buck’s novel The Good Earth, it is constantly made clear that farming families who begin selling off their land have entered a state of irreversible decline, since land is how they make their fortune. Local hosts and DJs are the “land” of radio companies. Who wants to listen to some generic hack being piped in from halfway across the country? When I tune in to a Syracuse station, I don’t want to hear the same pabulum about national politics I can get anywhere else; I want to hear about Syracuse or New York issues.

Unsurprisingly, these mass firings of local hosts lead to a death spiral for radio firms, with audiences leaving, ratings dropping, and revenue falling off. The response from the top was to fire even more local hosts, worsening the problem. Corporations also sought to unload their least profitable stations, or in the case of multi-media firms like Disney or CBS, divest themselves of their radio divisions entirely. As the housing bubble burst into the Great Recession, nobody wanted these turkeys on their hands.

With the economy contracting, radio executives withdrew into what was safe, familiar, and would cost them the least amount of money. CBS’ “Free FM” stations, which had failed to take off, were gradually flipped to various music formats; the last ones to go were KLSX in Los Angeles (ending Tom Leykis’ terrestrial radio career, as he had hosted that station’s afternoon drive program) and WJFK in Washington, D.C., both “blown up” in 2009. Companies began handing syndicated shows to TV talking heads and washed-up actors like Joe Scarborough, Dennis Miller, and Fred Thompson, which worked as well as when Air America tried it. Just scrape every piece of shit off the floor, load it into the cannon, and fire it at the wall. Something will stick eventually.

As a coda to this era, XM and Sirius, which terrestrial radio had feared for so long, merged in 2008 as a last-ditch measure to avoid mutual bankruptcy. This was approved by the FCC despite it creating a monopoly. That said, it was clear that satellite radio was so niche that having a monopoly on it was like owning all the toothpaste in England.

It was in this environment that Phil Hendrie abruptly announced that he was returning to radio.

The announcement came in June of 2007. The new Phil Hendrie show would air from 1-4AM Eastern (10PM-1AM Pacific) and would be syndicated by Talk Radio Network, which also distributed such heavyweights as Michael Savage and Laura Ingraham. Hendrie was keen to stress that it would be a straight talk show, not featuring his old characters.

Why Hendrie decided to return to radio after triumphantly declaring he was done with the industry the year before remains a mystery. I can only speculate based on what I knew at the time.

This is only my personal opinion, but I suspect that Hendrie was driven back to radio by financial necessity. In the wake of his 2006 retirement, Hendrie created a newsletter for his fans to keep up with his latest projects. I no longer have copies of the emails he sent out, but I vaguely recall him claiming in one that he had been hoping to work on a project with Simpsons creator Matt Groening. However, a glance at [his IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1042825/) shows that he only landed four roles during this time: a recurring role on The Unit, a two-episode role on The Replacements, a few episodes of King of the Hill, and a role in the “TV movie” Three Strikes. Additionally, in 2007, Hendrie divorced his wife, fellow talk show host Maria Sanchez. Again, this is just my opinion, but it is entirely possible Hendrie had no choice but to return to radio in order to pay his bills.

Hendrie’s new show launched on June 25, little more than a year after his “retirement.” It initially only aired on a handful of affiliates, though it would eventually expand to cover as many stations as his Premiere run, including its new flagship, KTLK 1150 in LA. Some stations, such as WGY, would air day-old recordings of the show in his old 10PM-1AM Eastern/7-10PM Pacific timeslot. I tuned in the first night on an Internet stream and was treated to the sound of an utterly broken man. Hendrie sounded bored, frustrated, and like he would rather be anywhere else.

Moreover, Hendrie simply could not handle hosting a normal talk show. Having spent much of his career interacting with callers via the crutch of his characters, free to deride them without consequences and fully aware of how stupid they were, he was adrift and listless without that crutch. During his first week, he took a call from a deranged woman who ranted for several minutes about how Barack Obama was the Antichrist. He nodded along in a stupor before thanking her, hanging up, and saying that no, he didn’t think Obama was the Antichrist.

I couldn’t believe what I’d just heard. The old Phil Hendrie would have torn that woman a new asshole and then shoved her head right through it. Bobbie Dooley, Jay Santos, or any of his other “guests” would have driven her to tears. The new Phil Hendrie couldn’t even muster the courage to politely disagree with her until she was safely off the line.

Hendrie was well-aware of how buckbroken he had become and how disastrous his attempt at being the late-night liberal Rush Limbaugh was going. Before the end of the week, on Friday’s show, he had already brought his old characters back, but with one catch: they were only on for short segments, with no callers. This was certainly an improvement over listening to him mumble through the day’s headlines, and he’d occasionally put together some bangers (such as the high school teacher “caucus” bit), but it was nowhere near his previous heights.

As the radio industry wheezed for breath, pressure groups discovered that yes, these white men can bleed.

Local hosts have never really been safe and could always find themselves in the unemployment line after going too far. Bob Grant was dethroned from WABC’s afternoon drive slot in 1996 after an off-the-cuff comment about the death of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown in a plane crash. A weekend host at WGY was fired during my college years for saying “asshole” and “blowjob” during the same show. But for the longest time, successful right-wing syndicated talkers were untouchable. That was, until the Great Recession.

The first major cancellation came in 2007, when Don Imus was [banished from his show](https://web.archive.org/web/20170718090519/http://www.today.com/popculture/cbs-fires-don-imus-radio-show-wbna18072804) barely a week after referring to the Rutgers University women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed hoes.” As far as Imus’ long list of sins went, it seemed kind of mild in context, seeing as his was the show where a guy [called for the mass murder of Palestinians](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100143/http://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/1067-palestinians-called-stinking-animals-on-msnbc-s-imus.html) and said that the Williams sisters were “animals,” among other things. Nonetheless, Imus’ show was dropped for the racist remark. I strongly suspect that MSNBC (which simulcast his show) and Westwood One (which syndicated it) had both wanted to replace Imus with a younger host for the longest time and saw the incident as a way to void his contract without looking ageist. Thanks to corporate abacus thinking, Imus would get a second wind later that year, hired by competitor WABC and re-launched into syndication as a replacement for Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby’s morning show, with the latter shown the door in yet another Great Recession budget cut. However, Imus’ new show would fail to reach the success it had during his tenure with MSNBC and Westwood One.

In 2012, Rush Limbaugh attacked Sandra Fluke, a Democratic political operative who testified to Congress advocating that Catholic institutions, such as Georgetown University (where she was a student), should be required to offer contraceptives without a co-pay as part of their insurance plans. Limbaugh’s remarks about Fluke, in which he called her a “slut” and a “prostitute,” galvanized a major boycott against his advertisers. Unlike previous efforts against Limbaugh, the Fluke campaign was successful, [resulting in his show losing numerous sponsors](https://web.archive.org/web/20140306032410/http://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2012/03/16/what-brands-can-learn-from-the-flush-rush-movement/) and many of his affiliates being outright blacklisted by advertisers. Many longtime affiliates, such as WABC, [would end up dropping the show](https://web.archive.org/web/20150531054625/http://darrylparks.com/2015/05/27/the-business-of-being-rush-limbaugh/), unable to afford Limbaugh’s carriage fee due to the loss of advertising revenue. The blacklist also impacted other shows, causing the collapse of the Wall Street Journal Radio Network due to their significant affiliate overlap with Limbaugh. For most of Rush’s career, program directors would have sold their mothers into slavery to get him on their stations. Now, he was dead weight.

## ***

On September 14, 2009, Phil Hendrie announced that his show would be returning to its original format: hour-long interviews with his merry band of eccentric guests, along with plenty of caller abuse. This change would coincide with a long, slow decline that would end with him leaving radio for good.

In the years following Hendrie’s return to his classic style, the show began shedding affiliates. This is bad for any syndicated show, but was amplified in the case of Hendrie’s program, since his shtick relied on a steady stream of clueless callers to ridicule. Hendrie blamed his syndicator, TRN, for failing to market his program effectively. Subscribers to his Backstage Pass service got to stream his show via his website, including uncensored moments during commercial breaks; during this time, Hendrie became known for flipping out and going on profanity-filled rants about TRN, which subscribers would record and post to fan forums for a laugh.

Hendrie's complaints about TRN likely have some validity. At the same time stations were dropping his show left and right, TRN was embroiled in a lawsuit with its star host, Michael Savage, who sought to end his contract with the company and void a clause that allowed TRN to match other offers in perpetuity. [Savage would ultimately win his lawsuit in 2012](https://rbr.com/michael-savage-wins-trn-suit-leaves-the-network/) after a court ruled that the clause was unenforceable, allowing him to finally take his show to another network. Two months after Savage's departure, another major TRN host, Laura Ingraham, would also leave the company. The fact that other hosts were having problems with TRN lends credibility to Hendrie's grievances. TRN would ultimately cease operations without warning in 2017.

However, Hendrie has historically had what could be described as a strained relationship with his fanbase. Some of what I'm about to describe comes from Hendrie fan sites that are no longer online and is being reconstructed from memory, so please take it with a grain of salt.

The Phil Hendrie Show attracted a cult following over the years, with numerous fans collecting airchecks (recordings) of Hendrie's broadcasts and becoming devotees to his unique brand of comedy. But Hendrie has always seemed to hold his fans in contempt. I remember reading a forum post in which Hendrie was described as bragging about how fans would, at in-person events, bring him little homemade gifts based on his various characters and he would just throw them in the garbage. When he initially retired in 2006, he began taking calls from actual fans for the first time, but he was always slightly snide or dismissive to them. One fan who called in said something to the effect of, " I don't know what I'm going to do with you off the air," to which Hendrie rudely replied along the lines of, "You could do literally anything else." Hendrie also remarked another time that [he felt personally bothered](https://www.reddit.com/r/philhendrie/comments/10q6ewv/comment/j6p9ls4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) when fans recognized him in public and asked for autographs.

I'm loathe to diagnose a man from afar, but Hendrie's self-aggrandizing behavior and belittling of his fans and others has a very narcissistic bent. On air, Hendrie would regularly proclaim himself to be a genius, that he was solely responsible for his show's success, that no one was as talented as him or capable of doing what he does. And when his show started circling the drain, he began lashing out and blaming everyone but himself. Many of his fans argued that the real reason Hendrie was losing affiliates was because he was no longer putting in the work, that the show was killing their ratings due to his clear disinterest in hosting a good program. Other fans have argued that part of the reason Hendrie initially retired in 2006—and why he was half-assing his new show by the end of the oughts—was because [the Internet made it increasingly difficult for him to fool callers as to who he was](https://www.reddit.com/r/philhendrie/comments/tl45jg/comment/i210xtr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), meaning he could no longer control conversations as adroitly as he could in the past, an affront to his sensibilities.

It's arguable that Hendrie's alienation from radio in 2006 and frequent criticisms of the medium may have been driven in part by his belief that he wasn't getting the recognition that he felt he deserved. It certainly seemed to fuel his resentment of Tom Leykis, who, whatever his flaws, hosted a more popular radio show than Hendrie, made more money, and retained his popularity after leaving the terrestrial airwaves. Leykis certainly seems to have a far more amiable relationship with his fanbase at least.

Another sore point between Hendrie and his fans was his insistence on issuing DMCA takedowns against anyone who posted clips of his show on YouTube or other sites. While I can understand why he wouldn't want his content being spread around for free, Hendrie's constant takedowns prevented his show from gaining a new audience in the Internet age. Hendrie's militant obsession with DMCAing his content went to the point where [he destroyed a fan site that was writing up detailed analyses of his shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/philhendrie/comments/tl45jg/comment/i1u63qj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), promoting his content for free, even writing an extremely nasty email to the owner.

On June 25, 2013, six years to the day when his show relaunched, Phil Hendrie ended his run on Talk Radio Network. His show would briefly migrate to Dial Global before leaving radio altogether in 2014. It now exists as a daily podcast known as The World of Phil Hendrie, released via his website. I've listened to the free episodes a few times, but it has the same problem that the 2007-2009 incarnation of his show had: the central comedy of Hendrie's program was the callers, not the guests.

More so than other kinds of radio programs, The Phil Hendrie Show can’t be replicated on the Internet. It relied on random cranks flipping through their dials, not knowing that his guests were fake, and picking up their rotary phones in a fit of contrived rage. Everyone who consumes Internet content does so willingly, with full knowledge of who the host is. There’s nobody to fool anymore.

## ***

On February 17, 2021, Rush Limbaugh passed away from lung cancer.

Many would likely cite his death as marking the end of talk radio itself, but in reality Limbaugh’s passing was more like the maggot biting off the final bit of flesh rather than the patient expiring. By the time Limbaugh died, corporate bean counting, mergers, budget cuts, and collapses had shrunk the radio industry to a fraction of its former size.

By the time Limbaugh went to that great broadcast booth in the sky, corporate bean counting, mergers, budget cuts, and collapses had shrunk the radio industry to a fraction of its former size. Local programming is an anachronism; even long-time holdouts such as WGN in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati have started to rely on syndicated programs. News departments are a joke. One of the talk stations in Syracuse went off the air in 2016 because the owner couldn’t afford to fix the transmitter. It stayed silent for a year before they eventually sold it to a Christian broadcaster.

In 2014, Clear Channel Communications renamed itself iHeartMedia. This was to acknowledge that its iHeartRadio online streaming platform had become its primary focus. Who under the age of 55 even knows what a clear channel station is anymore?

Radio’s complete failure to groom a successor for Limbaugh after over a decade of decimating its “farm team” of local hosts via nonstop budget cuts led to the absurdity of Premiere Networks (again, we see radio companies erasing radio references from their names) airing clip shows for three months after his passing while they scrambled to find a replacement. The eventual successors, a pair of unknown hacks named Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, continued to use Limbaugh’s old clips and “EIB Network” branding on their show for months afterward. This is the Con, Inc. version of the Soviets putting Lenin’s stuffed corpse on display in Red Square.

## ***

The last time I thought about Phil Hendrie, before I sat down to write this essay, was in 2016. He had gotten into a tiff with Mike Cernovich on Twitter.

I clicked over to Hendrie’s page. Every single Tweet was him freaking out over Donald Trump. Not funny, not lampooning the situation, just pure unadulterated fear. The old Phil Hendrie would have thought the idea of Trump running for president was hilarious. He’d have turned it into an hour-long interview with one of his “guests” and ended it with making a bunch of MAGA boomers look like total idiots. The new Phil Hendrie was wetting his diaper in public.

And he was getting ratioed by Cernovich. A guy who has a role on _Rick and Morty_, who used to have a million listeners, whose radio show was syndicated on the same network as Rush Limbaugh, _was getting ratioed by Mike Cernovich._

A glance at Hendrie’s IMDB page suggests that his acting career is doing okay. In addition to his aforementioned role as Principal Vagina, he’s also appeared in 41 episodes of _F is for Family_, 8 episodes of _The Midnight Gospel_, 3 episodes of _New Girl_, and a ton of other movies and TV shows. His website is presumably making money, with his Backstage Pass service offering unlimited access to his World of Phil Hendrie podcasts and his massive back catalogue of radio shows. I hope he’s doing well.

That said, a cursory glance at a subreddit dedicated to Phil Hendrie’s work indicates that fans have given up on him. Complaints range from him [being increasingly lazy with recording and uploading new podcasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/philhendrie/comments/14bfde9/he_actually_did_a_12_min_podcast_why_bother_and_3) to [his extraordinarily bitter attitude online](https://www.reddit.com/r/philhendrie/comments/10q6ewv/why_phil_never_went_mainstream/); he apparently spends much of his time arguing with fans on social media. One can argue that the only true character Hendrie ever played was the reasonable straight man, and the outlandish guests he portrayed, the ones who insulted and abused callers, were who he really was.

The radio transmitters are falling silent. Rush Limbaugh, Bob Grant, and Art Bell are all dead. Demographically, less than eight percent of talk radio listeners are in the desired 25-54 age range. Every time you see a hearse on the road, that’s another Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity fan off to the hereafter. This is likely why liberal calls to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine have faded—the most notable being [a bill introduced by Tulsi Gabbard in 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127185141/https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/116/hr4401) that failed to make it out of committee—and the focus is now on combating “disinformation” on social media platforms like Twitter, where the majority of Americans now get their entertainment.

I haven’t listened to the radio in well over a decade, but I can’t help but feel that its passage into the history books is an immeasurable cultural loss. There was something about talk radio that the Internet will never be able to capture. It was cool to drive down a highway at night, dial into faraway AM stations, and discover a host you wouldn’t ordinarily be able to pick up. Good talk hosts projected a certain intimacy with the listener, a unique charisma that’s been lost in an era where anyone with a $30 mic can record their thoughts and put them online. The feeling of listening to Art Bell or Steve LeVeille while hurtling down the Thruway is something no podcast is ever going to replicate.

More to the point, radio gave us a sort of unity. The Internet affords you a worldwide reach, but local hosts had a greater percentage of people in their hometowns hanging off their words. Bob Grant helped end the political careers of David Dinkins, Jim Florio, and Mario Cuomo. Chapo Trap House couldn’t even get Bernie Sanders past Super Tuesday. Yes, you can get your music from Spotify and your hot takes from Red Scare, but radio was more than a jukebox or a take machine. It was America itself, compressed into audio format and piped through your car speakers on your way home from work. NPR, talk radio, music: all of it.

Radio’s days were numbered when the Internet came around. Phil Hendrie, whatever his flaws and mistakes, saw what was coming. He built a career off of exploiting the industry’s flaws. But his act couldn’t make the transition to the new world.

### Sarasota, FL (1973)

According to the Miami Herald, Neil began his talk radio career at WSPB 1450 in Sarasota, FL.

> In 1973, Rogers moved to Sarasota, where quite by accident he did his first talk radio show. The station hired a retiree from Pittsburgh to do a talk show, but on his first day, the fellow couldn't figure out to work the phone and his guest didn't show up. The second day, the retiree's blood pressure soared and his nose bled. Rogers, who was spinning records at the station, came to the rescue.

### Other

- [Neil Rogers on MySpace](https://neilrogers.org/docs/neil-rogers-myspace/) - We have recovered his posts to MySpace from January 2007.
- _Cranker's Courier_ - In the mid 1980s a young man, while still in high school, began sending out a newsletter to various talk hosts. He was one of the most prolific crank callers in the Miami market, and managed to befriend some of the board ops. He was able to get inside information about the talk stations. Neil dubbed him Fruit Cake, and the moniker stuck. [Archive](https://archive.org/details/crankers-courier), [OneDrive PDF Folder](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgQrITkx1J-8pPcHiQJAWd_dwKJKGw?e=GyryKE)

### Support

There are several ways you can support the Neil Rogers Audio Restoration Project.

#### #1 Donate Audio

Do you have any audio of the Neil Rogers Show or other South Florida talk radio shows that you would like to share? Check our archives to see if we have a show from that date. If the show is before 1999 and it already exists in our archive, we may still able to use your audio. Most of the shows before 1999 are partial. Some are good quality and some aren‚Äôt. We can date the show and add to the archive.

We can convert cassettes to MP3s

Email **[\[email¬†protected\]](https://neilrogers.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**. Thank you!

#### #2 Listen and Write Show Notes

Our goal is to not only collect as much audio as possible but to index all the shows and make the topics searchable. Many of the shows from 2001-2009 do not have notes. Our goal is to have notes for every recovered show. This will make it easier for Neil fans to find the shows they are looking for.

1. Find a show without notes either on YouTube or our [Google Drive Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1czK9DiOqCK_P8lYS5Im8a_u9IZnKW39lBAuq3FXdmRM/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Listen to show and take notes.
3. Post the show notes either as a comment on the video or email them to [\[email¬†protected\]](https://neilrogers.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
4. Those notes will either be pinned (as top comment) and/or added to the show description.

#### #3 Share and Like

Spread the word to others about Uncle Neil by sharing links to everything we have saved. Give a like to the shows. The more fans that discover Neil is alive and well in the archives, the more likely we will find the fans that have more audio to add to our collection.

#### #4 Do You Know Someone That Works For Yahoo!?

In 1999 Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com, which archived the Neil Rogers Show in the early days. We need many of the shows from December 30, 1997, to January 19, 1999. They will be in Real Audio format.

Below is a list of URLs that might be clues as to what servers or backup archives these audio files might be found. **Please help us recover these shows!**

www.broadcast.com/radio/archives/wqam/rogers/

www.yahoo.com/radio/archives/wqam/rogers/

radio.yahoo.com//archives/wqam/rogers/

launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/

new.music.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/

music.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/

playlist.broadcast.com

Yahoo! will also have shows from 2000 to May 2002, which we need for our archives. I am absolutely convinced these shows exist somewhere on a backup of a Yahoo! server that the public does not have access to.

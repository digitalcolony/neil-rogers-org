### beasly

First, let me apologize to my listeners for the music on the show...but my patience with Joe Bell and the Beasleys is near an end. They have stubbornly refused to do anything to support my show, and the technical nightmare that's been going on is just part of it. In all my years in the business I have never encountered anyone like "Jolly" Joe Bell....he will agree with everything you say, and proceed to do NOTHING. For those of you who think the crank callers are funny, you'll have to tune in elsewhere to hear them. For these next two years(THE END) I will do the show the way I want....with OR without calls. It would be like writing a book to go thru all the insane things these people have done...suffice it to say they are pathetic. Amazingly, they consider themselves real broadcasters---I know, hold your laughter. Anyway, as of Tuesday, I'm going back to doing the show I believe in doing--with or without Joe Bell's help. He is joly..and very full of shit. A real PAPER TIGER. joyce Fitch in Naples is running the show...farts and all. Have a great day!!!! Neil

### myspace phantoms

AS long as I'm on this....maybe some of you know those two phantom "friends" I had on here who both played me like a violin. Be interested in hearing. The first of course was Jacob Voth, 32, who allegedly lives in the Nob Hill-Cleary area in Plantation and sells Health Insurance. The other "HUH" claimed his real first name was Brice...a high school senior...I think in Deerfield, Delray, or Boca. Anybody know these people???????

### this space

Guess what?! I changed my mind. Thanks to Mat with one T, and new friend on here. In checking out his friends, I discovered Mark...the university of North Fla soccer player and male model. All I can say is...HOLY SHIT!!!! Screw Jacob...Mark is well on his way to being in my will....just for being ALIVE!!! Imagine...a living and breathing YOUNG guy in Florida......Maybe Mat will arrange an online matchup...strictly for VERBAL intercourse purposes. This site can be as much fun as you want it to be. Just don't become addicted and take it for what it is. Never assume too much about the people you're talking to unless you know them. As far as the Beasleys and Joe Bell are concerned, THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND WON'T GET ANY SMARTER. I'll show up every day and do MY show the way I believe in doing it! In closing, MARK GOD!!!MMMMMMMMMMM..............!!!!!

### ASSHOLES

Must admit, Wednesday's show was great fun for me. We had a remarkable response on this site, and it was like a part0time job to reply to everyone when I got home.....but I enjoyed it. Lots of really neat people out there. DON'T WORRY...the show isn't going to be taken over by all MySpace talk...but it's more fun than screaming about this floppy-eared lunatic GW Bush who is right now talking pure, unadulterated BULLSHIT!! More deaths, more maimngs, more wasted lives....FOR WHAT??? Enough of that for now. Bottom line to this entry...there are many ASSHOLES out there..with NO LIVES...who will totally twist around what I'm doing on MySpace. TOO BAD!!! I'm not trolling for sex, for boyfriends, for naked pictues, etc. This has become lots of fun for me and a chance to interact with lots of listeners. If any asshole wants to conjure up other shit....GET A LIFE!! I'm not stupid OR desperate. As far as the previous entry about Jacob and HUH....let me say this----it's amazing that nobody in my VAST audience knows either of these people. I know Jacob is for real....I know him. As far as Brice(HUH)..who knows. But I'm sure that if he is for real, he is reading this blog every day. In that case, it would be nice to do the decent thing--put me back on as a "friend" open up the profile again, and let me know when you want to hear from my grumpy old ass. That would be the considerate thing to do....IF YOU ARE FOR REAL.........if this was all just a big tease...or trap...or whatever...I'm sure there will be no response. VERY SAD. And for those of you who want to lecture me about "letting go" etc....mind your own business!!!! I will admit I think I went way overboard on emailing Mark, the UNF Soccer guy....but who cares?! He probably has no idea who I am, and I will never email anybody on here FIRST..BAD IDEA!!! Anyhow, thanks for the amazing response today...we have 1018 "friends" at last count..not bad for this old queen in a venue designed for YOUNG people. As Jacob's ex-neighbor Joe said after that gruesome experience...this whole thing I think has brought me closer to the audience! THWEET~~~~~~

### bulletin

BULLETIN!!!!!!! It is 10pm on Wednesday night,c and I just got an email reply from Mark, the UNF soccer player. What a nice kid. Flattered by the attention. Here I go sounding like the ugly girl who just got invited to the prom by the star HS quarterback, but what a HOOT!!! See, I told you...I did the right thing by sending that email....LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!

### this site

Man, I am really pissed!!!!! This damn MySpace is WORSE than crack.....and I am definitelt not cur out for it. First..thanks to the MANY MANY listeners who have used this as a way of saying thanks for all the years of entertainment, etc. That's been great. But the rest of my experience on here has made me borderline NUTS!!! As soon as you ask for a bit of information about these guys...so you can feel certain who you're chatting with...the games begin. The couldn't give a SHIT less about me as a person. These are groupies....which is OK. But PLEASE don't put on an act for me and pretend to be a friend. Every time i think I have made a real on,ine friend on here, the games begin. My opinion is that...sure, lots of people will get laid from this site--that's fine. But if you think you will EVER make a real friend by chatting with people on here..YOU ARE DREAMING!!!! I'm fed up with it. The site will stay..the response has been amazing. BUT...no more delusions for me. I haven't encountered even one person on here whom I can call a friend..even of the online variety. I had a fabulous life BEFORE MySpace. My opinion has varied along with my experiences on here. But I won't be changing my opinion again. THis thing has made a wreck out of me(and lots of others). I am absolutely WILD over the way some of these people play their games....the disappearing acts...not reading your messages, etc. WHO THE HELL NEEDS THIS?? If I want to see beautiful young guys, I can walk outside onto the streets of Toronto. I never intended to get involved with this site..but then Jacob...and HUh..and now others...you all know the story. Enough of the BS.....I will answer the listeners and pay some attention to this, but no more psychosis. Even the people you thought you could trust are full of shit on here. Sorry, but MySpace is primarily for kids and OVERGROWN CHILDREN.....GOOD LUCK!!!! Neil

### this site, Part II

I didn't really complete my thoughts earlier....the steam is still coming out of my ears. If I was on this site trolling for sex or looking to play games with people, then I'd deserve what I get. But the thing that gets me is that every one of these guys claims to love the show..listened for years..etc etc. Then what is to be gained by screwing with my emotions??? Why send somebody dozens of friendly emails and then DISAPPEAR"" For what??? I guess it makes for good conversation with their buddies...like junior high school locker room pranks. PLEASE get me out of this. There are many many really nice people on our site, but for me the fun is gone...it is now debilitating. It's easy to say "quit doing this" but the alleged sincerity of these people gets me every time. I'll say it again..Making an ONLINE FRIEND ON MYSPACE IS LIKE FINDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS CASH IN YOUR BACKYARD...FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! Pissed off and fired up.....

### ALL CLEAR

This...I PROMISE..will be the last time you read the kind of neurotic posts you saw here last night. One of my biggest weaknesses is impatience. Combine that with having been burned badly twice on here already and you have the ingredients for really psychotic behavior. It is very hard to develop trust of people on here...they are reluctant to give proof of who or what they are. But late last night and this morning I got two long, neat emails from my two best online buddies plus made a new friend on here as well. I keep telling you "Don'y take this site too seriously"..etc. And then I go nuts myself. Call last night a bad "hiccup" in my involvement with this thing. Won't happen again. Like I've told you..life is good here...no complaints....although we finally have snow on the ground today. When I hear the nightmares that some other people have been thru on here, I consider myself VERY LUCKY. I hear from some really teriffic people on here everyday and appreciate it. Back to enjoy a well-deserved(lol) day off!!! Later, the world's oldest teenaged girl...NEIL

### tech problem

Well here we go sportsfans...Another crank...Ethan, with all the nearly nude pics, turns out to be a crank and has removed his fake profile. No problem there, but now I get home and the SEND feature looks like its sending out my emails, but it is not!! And they do NOT show up in the SENT column....???? Evidently, this faker has done something to screw up our site. If you don't get a reply from your email tonite(Wed, 1/17) its because my replies don't go out. Incoming seems fine. ANY IDEAS????? Thanks, Neil

The bad news is all sending AND receiving are down on MySpace....Thanks to our computer maven Eric for tracking this down. At least it wasn't that crank du jour Ethan screwing with us. As far as he is concerned I have only one comment...HUH????????

Hopefully, we'll be back to normal soon, after we're "INVESTIGATED"!!!! Oy!!!!!!!

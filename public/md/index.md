NeilRogers.org is created and maintained by a group of fans committed to preserving radio host Neil Rogers' legacy. Our main focus is finding and sharing audio recordings and photos.

The archive also features content from other notable Florida radio personalities, including Bob Lassiter, Stan Major, Rick & Suds, Ron Bennington, Bill Calder, Mike Spindell, and Glen Hill.

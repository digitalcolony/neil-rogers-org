description: How the carts worked at WIOD.
title: WIOD Cart Wars
---

Did you know? There were "cart wars" at the old WIOD. The rules of engagement were that you could NOT use Neil's carts, but Neil could use anyones and if he liked them, take them as his own and you were SOL.

Not because of some official rule; it's just the way it worked. Neil was the godfather and if he wanted to wet his beak with some of your show's sound effects, it was the price you paid for staying in his good favor.

Some examples: The Drew Michaels "Uh-NO!" and the "OKAY!" were both carted up for Randi after Drew had filled in for her.

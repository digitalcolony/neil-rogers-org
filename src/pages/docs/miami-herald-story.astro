		<h1>Miami Herald Covers the Neil Rogers Audio Recovery Project</h1>
		<p><em>by Michael Allen Smith - July 6, 2020</em></p>
		<p>
			Yesterday, I was interviewed by Jose Lambiet for a story about this website and the YouTube
			channel we created as a tribute to Neil Rogers.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a good article and I hope it attracts new fans and maybe new audio will be recovered.
		</p>

			page.

		<p>
			There were a few minor errors, which are probably to blame on my cell phone, which cut out
			several times during the interview.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				John Baker had his own personal collection of NEIL from the late 1980s. The audio we
				recovered before then and during the WIOD era (as well as the 1998 shows), were sent to him
				to restore, remaster, and convert to digital.
			</li>
			<li>
				I don't recall saying John was in Boca, but he might have lived there in the 1980s. John
				lived in Gainesville. I also don't know if Nick Abbot ever played Neil bits on his show. I
				do know Neil was an influence, which you can see on his Wikipedia page or his Twitter feed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Typo: “I moved to D.C. and I couldn't a radio signal in my office.” It should have read “I
				moved to D.C. and I couldn't get a radio signal in my office.” Again, my cell phone was
				breaking up during the interview.
			</li>
			<li>Neil was born in Rochester, NY not Canada.</li>
			<li>The archives aren't mine. They belong to all the fans.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here are some additional notes on the timeline of the project:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>June 12, 2009 — The last Neil Rogers Show</li>
			<li>December 24, 2010 — Neil Rogers dies</li>
			<li>2011 — Eric Harold (Neil's web guy dies)</li>
			<li>2011 — I start sharing audio via a Google Sites page</li>
			<li>2012 — The Neil Rogers YouTube channel is launched</li>
			<li>2012 — John Baker partners with me and we begin to build out the archive.</li>
			<li>2012 — NeilRogers.org starts</li>
			<li>2017 — John Baker dies.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The archive has almost 1,900 shows. Over 2,000 if you count other shows besides NEIL. This is
			5,000 hours of commercial-free audio.
		</p>

		<p>
			John Baker was the NEIL expert. Much more than me. I was the technical guy. When Eric Harold
			died, I stepped in to help out, because I have a background in programming, databases, and
			creating websites in general.

		<h1>🎙The Neil Rogers Show</h1>
		<p>
			NeilRogers.org is the work of a collection of fans dedicated to preserving the memory of
			radio’s Neil Rogers. Our primary goal is locating and sharing audio files. In addition to Neil
			Rogers, the archive includes audio from other Florida radio icons such as Bob Lassiter, Stan
			Major, Rick {"&"} Suds, Ron Bennington, Bill Calder, Mike Spindell, Glen Hill, and others.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have audio from Neil Rogers that you would like to share, we would love to add it to
			our archives. In addition to Neil, we also are archiving other Florida talk shows. Our email
			is{" "}
			<b>audio@neilrogers.org</b>. Thank you.

	<h3>Sarasota, FL (1973)</h3>

	<p>
		According to the Miami Herald, Neil began his talk radio career at WSPB 1450 in Sarasota, FL.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		In 1973, Rogers moved to Sarasota, where quite by accident he did his first talk radio show. The
		station hired a retiree from Pittsburgh to do a talk show, but on his first day, the fellow
		couldn't figure out to work the phone and his guest didn't show up. The second day, the
		retiree's blood pressure soared and his nose bled. Rogers, who was spinning records at the
		station, came to the rescue.
